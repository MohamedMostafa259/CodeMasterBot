interpreter,"The Python interpreter is typically found at /usr/local/bin/python3.12 on Unix systems. Adding /usr/local/bin to your shell's search path allows you to start it by typing ""python3.12"". Other locations are possible based on installation choices. On Windows with Python from the Microsoft Store$you can use the python3.12 command or the py.exe launcher. To exit the interpreter$use Control-D on Unix or Control-Z on Windows$or type quit().",Using the Python Interpreter@#- Invoking the Interpreter@#The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.12 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:@#@#python3.12@#to the shell. [1] Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option$other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g.$/usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)@#@#On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store$the python3.12 command will be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed$you can use the py command. See Excursus: Setting environment variables for other ways to launch Python.@#@#Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix$Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work$you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: quit().
if Statement$conditions$condition$conditional statements$conditional statement$Control Flow,if statements in Python:@#@#If statements are used to execute different code blocks based on conditions. If a condition is true$the associated block of code is executed; otherwise$it skips to the next condition or the else block if provided.,"In Python$if statements (conditions) are used to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

argument$Arguments, Arguments in Python:@#@#Arguments are values passed to functions or methods. They can be positional (in order)$keyword (with names)$or have default values. Functions can also accept arbitrary numbers of arguments using *args and **kwargs.,"In Python$arguments refer to the values that are passed to a function or method when it is called. Here's a breakdown:@#@#1)Positional Arguments:@#   These are arguments that are passed to a function in the order they are defined in the function's parameter list.@#   They are matched to the function parameters based on their position.@#2)Keyword Arguments:@#   These are arguments that are passed to a function with their corresponding parameter names.@#   They allow for more flexibility and clarity in function calls$as the order of arguments doesn't matter.@#3)Default Arguments:@#   These are arguments that have default values specified in the function definition.@#   If a value is not provided for a default argument in the function call$the default value is used.@#4)Arbitrary Arguments:@#   These are arguments that allow a function to accept an arbitrary number of positional or keyword arguments.@#   They are specified using *args for positional arguments and **kwargs for keyword arguments in the function parameter list.@#Here's an example to illustrate different types of arguments:@#  >>def greet(name$message=""Hello""$*args$**kwargs):@#          print(f""{message}${name}!"")@#@#      # Positional and default arguments@#      greet(""Alice"")  # Output: Hello$Alice!@#      greet(""Bob""$""Hi"")  # Output: Hi$Bob!@#@#      # Arbitrary positional and keyword arguments@#      greet(""Charlie""$""Hey""$""Nice to meet you""$mood=""happy"")@#      # Output: Hey$Charlie!@#In this example:@#@#""Alice"" is a positional argument passed to the name parameter$using the default value for message.@#""Bob"" and ""Hi"" are positional arguments passed to name and message parameters$respectively.@#""Charlie"" is a positional argument passed to name$""Hey"" is passed to message$and ""Nice to meet you"" is captured by *args.@#The keyword argument mood=""happy"" is captured by **kwargs."
break,The break statement in Python:@#@#The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a specific condition is met. It immediately terminates the loop and proceeds to the next statement after the loop.,In Python$the break statement is used to exit or terminate a loop prematurely. It is commonly used within loops such as for or while loops when a certain condition is met$allowing the loop to end before it has iterated through all its elements or completed all its iterations.@#@#Here's how the break statement works:@#@#1)Inside a for loop:@#  >>for item in iterable:@#              if condition:@#                     break@#      # Code here executes for each item until the condition is met@#2)Inside a while loop:@#  >>while condition:@#               if another_condition:@#                       break@#       # Code here executes until another_condition is met$at which point the loop exits@#When Python encounters the break statement$it immediately exits the innermost loop and continues with the next statement after the loop. If the break statement is inside nested loops$it only exits the innermost loop.@#@#Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of the break statement:@#  >>for i in range(10):@#               print(i)@#               if i == 5:@#                     break@#In this example$the loop iterates from 0 to 9. When i reaches 5$the condition i == 5 becomes true$and the break statement is executed. As a result$the loop terminates prematurely$and the program moves on to the next statement after the loop. Without the break statement$the loop would continue until it iterates through all numbers from 0 to 9.
continue,"continue statement: @#In Python$""continue"" is a keyword used within loops to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. When encountered$it jumps to the next iteration without executing the remaining code within the loop for that specific iteration.","The continue statement$borrowed from C$continues with the next iteration of the loop. For example:@#@#for num in range(2$10):@#    if num % 2 == 0:@#        print(""Found an even number""$num)@#        continue@#    print(""Found an odd number""$num)@#@#Outputs:@#@#Found an even number 2@#Found an odd number 3@#Found an even number 4@#Found an odd number 5@#Found an even number 6@#Found an odd number 7@#Found an even number 8@#Found an odd number 9"
pass, the `pass` statement in Python is a no-operation placeholder. It's used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed. It's commonly employed in situations like empty functions$classes$loops$or conditional blocks$serving as a temporary placeholder until actual code is added.,In Python$the pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it is executed. It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you don't want any command or code to execute.@#@#>> if condition:@#    pass  # This block does nothing@#else:@#    # Do something else@#This can be useful as a placeholder when you're writing code and you want to keep the structure intact but haven't yet implemented the functionality within a block.
match$pattern match,Pattern matching in Python$introduced in version 3.10$allows for concise conditional branching and value extraction from data structures like lists and dictionaries. It simplifies code by enabling direct matching of values$variable bindings$pattern-based matching$and guard clauses.,"@#@#A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. This is similar to a switch statement in C$Java$or JavaScript$but it’s more akin to pattern matching in languages like Rust or Haskell. Only the first pattern that matches gets executed$and it can also extract components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.@#@#The simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:@#@#def http_error(status):@#    match status:@#        case 400:@#            return ""Bad request""@#        case 404:@#            return ""Not found""@#        case 418:@#            return ""I'm a teapot""@#        case _:@#            return ""Something's wrong with the internet""@#@#Note the last block: the ""variable name"" `_` acts as a wildcard and never fails to match. If no case matches$none of the branches is executed."
Defining Function$define function$declare function$declaring function$create function$creating function$make function$making function$Defining Functions$define functions$declare functions$declaring functions$create functions$creating functions$make functions$making functions$function definition,Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code defined using the `def` keyword. They allow you to break down tasks into smaller$manageable pieces$improving code organization and reusability. Functions can accept input parameters$return values$have default parameters$and support variable numbers of arguments. They play a crucial role in modularizing code and enhancing readability.,In Python$a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller$manageable pieces$making your code more organized$easier to understand$and more maintainable. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts related to functions in Python:@#@#Defining a Function: To define a function in Python$you use the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses ( )$which may include parameters (arguments) if the function accepts input. The function body is indented below the def statement.@#>>def my_function(parameter1$parameter2):@#    # Function body@#    # Code goes here@#Calling a Function: To execute a function and perform its task$you call the function by using its name followed by parentheses ( )$optionally passing arguments if the function expects them.@#>>my_function(value1$value2)@#Return Statement: Functions in Python may return a value using the return statement. This allows the function to compute a result and pass it back to the caller.@#>>def add(x$y):@#    return x + y
Special parameters$Special parameter,By default$arguments may be passed to a Python function either by position or explicitly by keyword. For readability and performance$it makes sense to restrict the way arguments can be passed so that a developer need only look at the function definition to determine if items are passed by position$by position or keyword$or by keyword.@#@#A function definition may look like:@#@#def f(pos1$pos2$/$pos_or_kwd$*$kwd1$kwd2):@#      -----------    ----------     ----------@#        |             |                  |@#        |        Positional or keyword   |@#        |                                - Keyword only@#         -- Positional only@#where$and * are optional. If used$these symbols indicate the kind of parameter by how the arguments may be passed to the function: positional-only$positional-or-keyword$and keyword-only.

Lexical analysis,Lexical analysis in Python is the process of breaking source code into tokens like keywords$identifiers$and literals. It's the initial phase of compilation$where characters are scanned and grouped based on predefined rules$forming the basis for further processing.,Lexical analysis$often referred to as lexing$is the initial phase of Python's compilation process. It involves breaking the source code into a sequence of tokens$which are the smallest meaningful units such as keywords$identifiers$literals$operators$and punctuation symbols. Python's lexer scans through the source code character by character$identifying these tokens based on predefined rules$like whitespace or special characters delineating tokens. The output of lexical analysis is a stream of tokens that forms the input for the subsequent stages of the Python compiler$like parsing and interpretation.
Line structure$Lines structure,A Python program is divided into a number of logical lines.,A Python program is segmented into several logical lines.
Logical lines$logical line,In Python$logical lines are lines of code treated as individual statements by the interpreter. They can span multiple physical lines if separated by line continuation characters or contained within parentheses$brackets$or braces.,In Python$logical lines represent lines of code that the interpreter treats as separate statements. Unlike many other languages$Python does not require explicit statement terminators like semicolons. Instead$it uses indentation to denote the beginning and end of blocks of code. A single physical line can contain one or more logical lines if they're separated by explicit line continuation characters like backslashes (`\`) or are contained within parentheses$brackets$or braces$without needing explicit line continuation.
Physical lines$physical line,In Python$physical lines are the lines of code as they appear in the script or file$usually corresponding to individual statements$but they can be continued onto multiple lines using backslashes or contained within parentheses$brackets$or braces.,In Python$physical lines refer to the actual lines of code as they appear in the script or file. Each physical line typically corresponds to a single statement$but a statement can span multiple physical lines if it's broken using a line continuation character `\` or if it's contained within parentheses$brackets$or braces. Physical lines are what you see when you open a Python script or file in a text editor.
Comments$comment,In Python$comments are annotations within the code that are ignored by the interpreter but provide valuable explanations or context to human readers. They start with the `#` symbol and can be placed on their own line or at the end of a line of code. Comments help document code$clarify its purpose$and make it easier to understand and maintain.,A comment begins with a hash character (#) that is not within a string literal and continues until the end of the line. It marks the end of the logical line unless implicit line joining rules are at play. Comments are disregarded by the syntax.
Explicit joining,Explicit line joining in Python is achieved by using the backslash (`\`) at the end of each line to continue a single logical line across multiple physical lines$helpful for improving code readability when a statement is too long to fit on one line.,Explicit line joining in Python allows you to continue a single logical line of code across multiple physical lines. This is achieved by using the backslash (\) character at the end of each line that you want to join. It's typically used when a single statement is too long to fit on one line for readability purposes. For example:@#>>result = 10 + \@#         20 + \@#         30@#Here$the backslashes indicate that the addition operation continues onto the next line$forming a single logical line.
Implicit joining,In Python$implicit line joining allows certain constructs to span multiple lines without the need for explicit line continuation characters like backslashes. For instance$expressions within parentheses$square brackets$or curly braces can automatically continue onto the next line. This feature enhances code readability and reduces the need for explicit line continuation in certain contexts.,Expressions in parentheses$square brackets or curly braces can be split over more than one physical line without using backslashes. For example:@#@#month_names = ['Januari'$'Februari'$'Maart'$    # These are the@#               'April'$ 'Mei'$    'Juni'$     # Dutch names@#               'Juli'$  'Augustus'$'September'$# for the months@#               'Oktober'$'November'$'December']   # of the year@#Implicitly continued lines can carry comments. The indentation of the continuation lines is not important. Blank continuation lines are allowed. There is no NEWLINE token between implicit continuation lines. Implicitly continued lines can also occur within triple-quoted strings (see below); in that case they cannot carry comments.

The indentation of the continuation lines is not important. Blank continuation lines are allowed. There is no NEWLINE token between implicit continuation lines. Implicitly continued lines can also occur within triple-quoted strings (see below); in that case they cannot carry comments.
Blank lines$blank line,A logical line that contains only spaces$tabs$formfeeds and possibly a comment$is ignored (i.e.$no NEWLINE token is generated). During interactive input of statements$handling of a blank line may differ depending on the implementation of the read-eval-print loop. In the standard interactive interpreter$an entirely blank logical line (i.e. one containing not even whitespace or a comment) terminates a multi-line statement.,A logical line that includes only spaces$tabs$formfeeds$and possibly a comment is not considered (i.e.$no NEWLINE token is produced). When interacting with input statements$how a blank line is handled may vary depending on the implementation of the read-eval-print loop. In the standard interactive interpreter$a completely empty logical line (one without any whitespace or a comment) ends a multi-line statement.
Indentation,Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line$which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.@#@#Tabs are replaced (from left to right) by one to eight spaces such that the total number of characters up to and including the replacement is a multiple of eight (this is intended to be the same rule as used by Unix). The total number of spaces preceding the first non-blank character then determines the line’s indentation. Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation.@#@#Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in spaces; a TabError is raised in that case.,Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the start of a logical line is utilized to calculate the indentation level$which is subsequently used to establish the grouping of statements.@#@#Tabs are substituted (from left to right) with one to eight spaces in such a way that the total count of characters$including the replacement$is divisible by eight (this follows the rule commonly used by Unix). The total number of spaces before the first non-blank character determines the line's indentation. Indentation cannot be distributed across multiple physical lines using backslashes; the whitespace leading up to the initial backslash establishes the indentation.@#@#Inconsistently mixing tabs and spaces in a source file$in a manner that renders the interpretation dependent on the tab's value in spaces$results in rejected indentation. In such cases$a TabError is raised.
Keywords,The following identifiers are used as reserved words$or keywords of the language$and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as written here:@#@#False      await      else       import     pass@#None       break      except     in         raise@#True       class      finally    is         return@#and        continue   for        lambda     try@#as         def        from       nonlocal   while@#assert     del        global     not        with@#async      elif       if         or         yield,The following identifiers are used as reserved words$or keywords of the language$and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers.

Objects$values$types$object,In Python$objects are instances of classes$representing data and associated behaviors. They encapsulate both attributes (data) and methods (functions) to manipulate that data$enabling modular and reusable code.,In Python$everything is an object. An object is a data structure that contains data (attributes) and code (methods) to manipulate that data. Objects are instances of classes$which are blueprints for creating objects with specific characteristics and behaviors. Python's object-oriented nature allows for easy manipulation and organization of data through the creation and interaction of objects$facilitating modular and reusable code.
None,In Python$`None` represents the absence of a value. It's commonly used to signify a lack of meaningful data or to initialize variables before assigning them a value.,In Python$`None` is a special constant representing the absence of a value or a null value. It's often used to signify that a variable or expression doesn't have a meaningful value or hasn't been assigned yet. `None` is a singleton object of the `NoneType` class and is frequently used as a default return value for functions or to initialize variables before assigning them a meaningful value.
NotImplemented,In Python$`NotImplemented` is a special constant returned by methods to indicate that an operation is not implemented for a given object or data type. It's commonly used to handle unsupported operations gracefully within the language's protocols and object-oriented designs.,In Python$`NotImplemented` is a special constant used to indicate that a method or operation is not implemented for a particular object or data type. It's often returned by methods that are part of an interface but haven't been defined in subclasses$signaling that the operation isn't supported in the current context. It allows for graceful handling of unsupported operations or methods within the language's protocols and object-oriented designs.
Ellipsis,In Python$the ellipsis (`...`) is a special constant represented by three consecutive dots. It's primarily used as a placeholder or marker in various contexts$indicating that some code or functionality is intentionally left incomplete or to be filled in later. Ellipses are commonly seen in slicing syntax$type hinting$and in indicating unfinished code or functions.,The type represented by the ellipsis (`...`) or the built-in name `Ellipsis` is characterized by a single value$with only one object holding this value. This object can be accessed using either the literal `...` or the built-in name `Ellipsis`. Notably$its truth value is true.
Number numbers,In Python$`numbers.Number` is an abstract base class representing numeric types like integers$floats$and complex numbers. It provides a consistent interface for common numeric operations$facilitating code interoperability and polymorphic behavior.,In Python$`numbers.Number` is an abstract base class that serves as a base for numeric types in the language's hierarchy. It's part of the `numbers` module and provides a common interface for numeric types like integers$floats$and complex numbers. This abstract base class defines methods and properties common to numeric types$allowing for consistent behavior across different numeric data types.
integral numbers,In Python$`numbers.Integral` is an abstract base class representing integer numeric types. It serves as a base for integer types like `int` and `bool`. This abstract base class defines methods common to integer types$allowing for consistent behavior and interoperability among them.,"Integers in Python represent elements from the mathematical set of integers$encompassing both positive and negative values.@#@#Regarding integer representation$the rules are devised to offer the most meaningful interpretation of shift and mask operations involving negative integers. There are two categories of integers:@#@#1. Integers (`int`): These represent numbers within an unrestricted range$limited only by available (virtual) memory. For shift and mask operations$a binary representation is employed$with negative numbers represented using a variant of 2's complement. This representation creates the illusion of an infinite sequence of sign bits extending to the left.@#@#2. Booleans (`bool`): These embody the truth values False and True. There exist only two objects representing these values. Booleans are a subtype of the integer type$and they behave akin to the values 0 and 1 in most contexts. However$when converted to a string$they yield the strings ""False"" or ""True$"" respectively."
Real numbers,In Python$`numbers.Real` is an abstract base class representing real number numeric types$primarily floats. It serves as a base for floating-point numeric types like `float`. This abstract base class defines methods common to real number types$enabling consistent behavior and interoperability among them.,These denote machine-level double-precision floating-point numbers$whose accepted range and handling of overflow are determined by the underlying machine architecture and the implementation of C or Java. Python does not include support for single-precision floating-point numbers. The potential savings in processor and memory usage$which are often the rationale for using single-precision numbers$are outweighed by the overhead of employing objects in Python. Consequently$there is no justification for introducing two types of floating-point numbers in the language.
Sequences,In Python$sequences are ordered collections of items. They can be indexed and sliced$allowing access to individual elements or subgroups. Common sequence types include lists$tuples$and strings. Sequences support iteration$concatenation$and various other operations$making them versatile for storing and manipulating data.,Sequences in Python are like lists or strings; they're collections of items you can count through. They keep things in order$and you can pick out just one thing or groups of things. Think of it like a line of people
Bytes$byte,In Python$`bytes` is a data type representing a sequence of bytes. It's immutable$meaning its values cannot be changed after creation. Bytes are often used to represent raw binary data$such as images$audio files$or network packets. You can create bytes objects using a bytes literal$b''$or the bytes() constructor function. They're useful for handling binary data efficiently and accurately.,A bytes object in Python represents an immutable array where each item is an 8-bit byte$with integer values ranging from 0 to 255. Bytes literals$denoted by a leading 'b'$such as b'abc'$and the built-in bytes() constructor$can be used to instantiate bytes objects. Additionally$bytes objects can be decoded into strings using the decode() method.
Byte Arrays,In Python$a `bytearray` is a mutable sequence of bytes$allowing modification of its elements after creation. It's commonly used for tasks involving mutable binary data$such as file I/O or network communication$offering flexibility and efficiency.,In Python$a `bytearray` is a mutable sequence of bytes. It's similar to the `bytes` data type but differs in that it allows modification of its elements after creation. Bytearrays are often used when you need to manipulate binary data in-place$such as when reading from or writing to files or network sockets. They offer flexibility and efficiency for tasks involving mutable byte sequences. You can create a bytearray using the `bytearray()` constructor function.
Set types,Sets in Python are collections of unique elements. There are two types: mutable sets (`set`)$which allow modification$and immutable sets (`frozenset`)$which don't allow modification once created.,In Python$a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable$which means you can add or remove elements from them. There are two main types of sets in Python:@#@#Mutable Sets (set): The built-in set type in Python allows you to create mutable sets. You can add or remove elements from these sets. Mutable sets are defined using curly braces {}.@#>>my_set = {1$2$3$4$5}@#You can add elements to a set using the add() method:@#>>my_set.add(6)@#Immutable Sets (frozenset): The frozenset type in Python creates immutable sets$meaning once created$you cannot add or remove elements from them. Immutable sets are defined using the frozenset() function.@#>>my_immutable_set = frozenset({1$2$3$4$5}) 
Sets$set,These represent a mutable set. They are created by the built-in set() constructor and can be modified afterwards by several methods$such as add().,Sets in Python are collections of unique and mutable objects$and you create them using the built-in `set()` constructor. Once created$you can modify them using various methods$such as `add()` for adding new elements to the set. This mutability means you can change the contents of the set after its creation$making it a versatile data structure for tasks like dynamic membership management and data manipulation.
Mapping,Mapping in Python refers to the process of applying a function to each element of an iterable (like a list) and returning an iterable of the results. This is typically done using the `map()` function$which takes the function to apply and the iterable as arguments.,In Python$mapping refers to the process of applying a function to each item in a sequence$such as a list$tuple$or set$and collecting the results into a new sequence. The map() function is commonly used for this purpose.@#@#Here's a basic explanation of how mapping works in Python:@#@#The map() function: The map() function takes two arguments: a function and one or more iterable objects (e.g.$lists$tuples). It applies the function to each item in the iterables and returns an iterator that yields the results.@#Function argument: The first argument to map() is the function that you want to apply to each item in the iterable(s). This can be a built-in function$a user-defined function$or even a lambda function.@#Iterable objects: The remaining arguments to map() are the iterable objects whose elements you want to apply the function to. You can pass one or more iterables$but they must all have the same length. If multiple iterables are passed$map() will apply the function to corresponding elements from each iterable.@#Output: The output of map() is an iterator that yields the result of applying the function to each item in the input iterables. You can convert this iterator to a list$tuple$or any other iterable type if you want to work with the results as a collection.@#>># Define a function@#def square(x):@#    return x ** 2@#@## Create a list of numbers@#numbers = [1$2$3$4$5]@#@## Apply the square function to each number using map()@#squared_numbers = map(square$numbers)@#@## Convert the iterator to a list to see the results@#print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1$4$9$16$25]
Dictionaries$dictionary$map,  Python$dictionaries are data structures that store collections of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and are used to access corresponding values quickly. Dictionaries are versatile for organizing$accessing$and modifying data efficiently.,In Python$a dictionary is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It's often used when you need to organize and retrieve data based on some unique identifier$which is the key. Each key in a dictionary must be unique$but the values can be duplicated.@#@#Here's a basic explanation of how dictionaries work:@#@#1. **Creation**: You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` and separating key-value pairs with colons `:`. For example:@#@#```python@#my_dict = {'name': 'John'$'age': 30$'city': 'New York'}@#```@#@#2. **Accessing values**: You can access the value associated with a specific key by using square brackets `[]` with the key inside. For example:@#@#```python@#print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: John@#```@#@#3. **Adding or modifying elements**: Dictionaries are mutable$so you can add new key-value pairs or modify existing ones easily:@#@#```python@#my_dict['email'] = 'john@example.com'  # Adding a new key-value pair@#my_dict['age'] = 31  # Modifying the value of an existing key@#```@#@#4. **Removing elements**: You can remove key-value pairs from a dictionary using the `del` keyword or the `pop()` method:@#@#```python@#del my_dict['city']  # Removing a key-value pair@#removed_value = my_dict.pop('age')  # Removing and returning the value associated with a key@#```@#@#5. **Iterating through a dictionary**: You can iterate over the keys$values$or key-value pairs of a dictionary using loops:@#@#```python@## Iterating over keys@#for key in my_dict:@#    print(key)@#@## Iterating over values@#for value in my_dict.values():@#    print(value)@#@## Iterating over key-value pairs@#for key$value in my_dict.items():@#    print(key$value)@#```@#@#Dictionaries are widely used in Python due to their flexibility and efficiency in storing and retrieving data. They are particularly useful for tasks like storing settings$mapping identifiers to values$or representing complex data structures.
global function,A reference to the dictionary that holds the function’s global variables – the global namespace of the module in which the function was defined.,The reference to the dictionary containing the function's global variables refers to the global namespace of the module in which the function was defined. This dictionary holds all the variables and objects defined at the module level$including those accessible to the function. It serves as the storage space for variables that are accessible from anywhere within the module$acting as a sort of shared memory for the module's components.
Closure Function,None or a tuple of cells that contain bindings for the function’s free variables.@#@#A cell object has the attribute cell_contents. This can be used to get the value of the cell$as well as set the value.,This is an attribute of a function that returns a tuple of cell objects if the function is a closure. Closures are functions that remember values from their enclosing lexical scope even when the program flow is no longer in that scope. def outer(x):@#    def inner(y):@#        return x + y@#    return inner@#@#closure_func = outer(10)@#print(closure_func.__closure__)  # Output shows a tuple containing a cell holding the value of 'x'

type parameters,The type parameters of generic classes$functions$and type aliases.,Not a standard Python attribute. This might be a custom attribute in specific contexts or frameworks$typically used to specify type parameters in generic programming constructs$particularly in typing or similar modules.                                                                                                                                                                                                      This is not a standard attribute in Python and could relate to custom implementations$especially in type hinting contexts$so a standard example might not be applicable.
Instance methods$methods,method.__self__ method.__func__method.__doc__ method.__name__ method.__module__," Methods of a class that operate on instances of that class. They are functions defined inside a class that take the instance self as the first argument.                                                                                                                                            class MyClass:@#    def my_method(self):@#        print(""Hello from an instance method!"")@#@#obj = MyClass()@#obj.my_method()  # Output: Hello from an instance method!"

Generator functions,Generator functions in Python use the `yield` statement to produce a sequence of values lazily$allowing for memory-efficient iteration. They retain their state between calls and are ideal for processing large datasets or infinite sequences.,Generator functions in Python are special functions that allow you to generate a sequence of values lazily$meaning they produce values on-the-fly as they are needed$rather than generating them all at once and storing them in memory. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.@#@#Here's how a generator function differs from a regular function:@#@#Yield statement: Instead of using return to return a value and exit the function$a generator function uses the yield statement to yield a value to the caller and temporarily suspend the function's execution. When the generator function is called again$it resumes execution from where it left off.@#State retention: Generator functions retain their state between calls. This means they remember where they were in the code$including the values of local variables$when they were last called.@#Iteration protocol: Generator functions can be used in a loop or with other iterable constructs just like regular collections. Each time the loop iterates$the generator function produces the next value in the sequence.@#Here's a simple example of a generator function that generates even numbers:@#>>def generate_even_numbers():@#    num = 0@#    while True:@#        yield num@#        num += 2@#@## Using the generator function@#even_gen = generate_even_numbers()@#print(next(even_gen))  # Output: 0@#print(next(even_gen))  # Output: 2@#print(next(even_gen))  # Output: 4@#In this example$generate_even_numbers() is a generator function that produces even numbers indefinitely. Each time next(even_gen) is called$it yields the next even number in the sequence.@#@#Generator functions are memory efficient because they don't store the entire sequence in memory at once; instead$they produce values as needed. They're especially useful when dealing with large datasets or when you only need to iterate through a sequence once.@#@#

Understanding how to properly use indexing can greatly enhance your ability to work with data in Python."
import statement,In Python$the import statement is used to bring in functionality from other modules or packages into your current script. It helps you reuse code and organize your project by accessing functions$classes$or variables defined elsewhere.,@#In Python$the import statement is used to bring functionality from other modules or packages into your current Python script or module. This allows you to reuse code and organize your codebase into logical components.@#@#Here's how the import statement works:@#@#Basic Import: You can import an entire module by using the import keyword followed by the name of the module. For example:@#>>import math@#This imports the entire math module$allowing you to use functions and constants from it$such as math.sqrt() or math.pi.@#@#Import with Alias: You can import a module with an alias using the as keyword.

This can be essential when you want to operate on variables that are not initially of compatible types. Type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.@#@#Implicit Conversion (Automatic)@#Implicit conversion$or coercion$happens when the compiler automatically converts one type of data into another. This is usually done when:@#@#Expressions require values of a different data type.@#The conversion is safe and does not lead to unexpected consequences.@#For example$in many languages$if you perform arithmetic operations between an integer and a floating-point number$the integer will automatically be converted to a float to avoid loss of precision:@#@#python@#Copy code@#number_int = 5     # Integer@#number_float = 5.0 # Float@#@## Automatic conversion of integer to float for this operation@#result = number_int + number_float@#Explicit Conversion (Manual)@#Explicit conversion involves converting the data type of a variable or value manually by the programmer.

Some examples:@#@#>>>@#bin(3)@#'0b11'@#bin(-10)@#'-0b1010'@#If the prefix “0b” is desired or not$you can use either of the following ways.@#@#>>>@#format(14$'#b')$format(14$'b')@#('0b1110'$'1110')@#f'{14:#b}'$f'{14:b}'@#('0b1110'$'1110'), Convert an integer number to a binary string prefixed with “0b”.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                         print(bin(10))  # Output: '0b1010'
breakpoint(),This function drops you into the debugger at the call site. Specifically$it calls sys.breakpointhook()$passing args and kws straight through. By default$sys.breakpointhook() calls pdb.set_trace() expecting no arguments. In this case$it is purely a convenience function so you don’t have to explicitly import pdb or type as much code to enter the debugger. However$sys.breakpointhook() can be set to some other function and breakpoint() will automatically call that$allowing you to drop into the debugger of choice. If sys.breakpointhook() is not accessible$this function will raise RuntimeError.@#@#By default$the behavior of breakpoint() can be changed with the PYTHONBREAKPOINT environment variable. See sys.breakpointhook() for usage details.@#@#Note that this is not guaranteed if sys.breakpointhook() has been replaced.@#@#Raises an auditing event builtins.breakpoint with argument breakpointhook., Drops you into the debugger at the call site.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                       # Use this in your code to enter debug mode@## breakpoint()
callable(),Return True if the object argument appears callable$False if not. If this returns True$it is still possible that a call fails$but if it is False$calling object will never succeed. Note that classes are callable (calling a class returns a new instance); instances are callable if their class has a __call__() method.,Check if the object appears callable (i.e.$some kind of function). Returns True if the object is callable$False if not.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                         @#  >> def myfunc():@#            pass@#            print(callable(myfunc))  # Output: True
delattr(),This is a relative of setattr(). The arguments are an object and a string. The string must be the name of one of the object’s attributes. The function deletes the named attribute$provided the object allows it. For example$delattr(x$'foobar') is equivalent to del x.foobar. name need not be a Python identifier (see setattr()).@#,Deletes the named attribute from the object.@#Example:                                                          @#  >>class MyClass:@#                attribute = 5@#                obj = MyClass()@#              delattr(obj$'attribute')@## Trying to access obj.attribute will now raise an AttributeError
dict()$dict,Create a new dictionary. The dict object is the dictionary class. See dict and Mapping Types — dict for documentation about this class.@#@#For other containers see the built-in list$set$and tuple classes$as well as the collections module,Create a new dictionary with the passed keyword arguments.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                    my_dict = dict(apple=10$banana=20)@#print(my_dict)  # Output: {'apple': 10$'banana': 20}   
divmod()$divmod function,Take two (non complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder when using integer division.@#Example:@#  >>print(divmod(7$2)) @#      # Output: (3$1) -- 3 is quotient$1 is remainder,Take two (non-complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder when using integer division. With mixed operand types$the rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For integers$the result is the same as (a // b$a % b). For floating point numbers the result is (q$a % b)$where q is usually math.floor(a$b) but may be 1 less than that. In any case q * b + a % b is very close to a$if a % b is non-zero it has the same sign as b$and 0 <= abs(a % b) < abs(b)
enumerate()$enumerate function,Return an enumerate object$iterable must be a sequence$an iterator$or some other object which supports iteration.@#Example:                    @#  >>for index$value in enumerate(['a'$'b'$'c']):@#      print(index$value)  @#      # Output: 0 a$1 b$2 c,Return an enumerate object. iterable must be a sequence$an iterator$or some other object which supports iteration. The __next__() method of the iterator returned by enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over iterable.@#@#>>>@#seasons = ['Spring'$'Summer'$'Fall'$'Winter']@#list(enumerate(seasons))@#[(0$'Spring')$(1$'Summer')$(2$'Fall')$(3$'Winter')]@#list(enumerate(seasons$start=1))@#[(1$'Spring')$(2$'Summer')$(3$'Fall')$(4$'Winter')]@#Equivalent to:@#@#def enumerate(iterable$start=0):@#    n = start@#    for elem in iterable:@#        yield n$elem@#        n += 1
eval()$eval function, Executes a Python expression passed as a string and returns the result.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                        @#  >>x = 1@#       print(eval('x + 1'))  @#        # Output: 2,The arguments are a string and optional globals and locals. If provided$globals must be a dictionary. If provided$locals can be any mapping object.@#@#The expression argument is parsed and evaluated as a Python expression (technically speaking$a condition list) using the globals and locals dictionaries as global and local namespace. If the globals dictionary is present and does not contain a value for the key __builtins__$a reference to the dictionary of the built-in module builtins is inserted under that key before expression is parsed. That way you can control what builtins are available to the executed code by inserting your own __builtins__ dictionary into globals before passing it to eval(). If the locals dictionary is omitted it defaults to the globals dictionary. If both dictionaries are omitted$the expression is executed with the globals and locals in the environment where eval() is called. Note$eval() does not have access to the nested scopes (non-locals) in the enclosing environment.@#@#The return value is the result of the evaluated expression. Syntax errors are reported as exceptions. Example:@#@#>>>@#x = 1@#eval('x+1')@#2
exec()$exec function,"Executes dynamically created Python code which can be a string or object code.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                 @#  >>exec('print(""Hello World"")')  @#       # Output: Hello World",This function supports dynamic execution of Python code. object must be either a string or a code object. If it is a string$the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed (unless a syntax error occurs). [1] If it is a code object$it is simply executed. In all cases$the code that’s executed is expected to be valid as file input (see the section File input in the Reference Manual). Be aware that the nonlocal$yield$and return statements may not be used outside of function definitions even within the context of code passed to the exec() function. The return value is None.
filter()$filter function$filter,filter() takes a function and an iterable. It returns an iterator containing elements from the iterable for which the function returns True. For example$filter(is_even$numbers) would give you an iterator with only even numbers from the list numbers.,"The filter() function in Python is used to filter elements from an iterable (like a list$tuple$etc.) based on a given function. It takes two arguments:@#@#1)function: This is a function that returns a boolean value (True or False). The function is applied to each element of the iterable$and only those elements for which the function returns True are included in the output.@#2)iterable: This is the iterable (e.g.$list$tuple) from which elements are to be filtered.@#Here's the syntax of the filter() function:@#@#  >>filter(function$iterable)@#The filter() function returns an iterator containing the elements for which the function returns True.@#@#Here's a simple example to illustrate how the filter() function works:@#  >># Function to check if a number is even@#      def is_even(num):@#            return num % 2 == 0@#      # List of numbers@#      numbers = [1$2$3$4$5$6$7$8$9$10]@#@#      # Filter even numbers using the is_even function@#      even_numbers = filter(is_even$numbers)@#@#      # Convert the filter object to a list@#      even_numbers_list = list(even_numbers)@#@#      print(""Even numbers:""$even_numbers_list)@#      Output:@#@#  >>Even numbers: [2$4$6$8$10]@#In this example$the is_even() function is used as the function argument to filter(). The filter() function applies the is_even() function to each element of the numbers list. It returns an iterator containing only those elements for which the is_even() function returns True$i.e.$the even numbers. Finally$the iterator is converted to a list and printed."
format()$format function,Convert a value to a “formatted” representation$as controlled by format_spec. The interpretation of format_spec will depend on the type of the value argument; however$there is a standard formatting syntax that is used by most built-in types: Format Specification Mini-Language.@#@#The default format_spec is an empty string which usually gives the same effect as calling str(value).@#@#A call to format(value$format_spec) is translated to type(value).__format__(value$format_spec) which bypasses the instance dictionary when searching for the value’s __format__() method. A TypeError exception is raised if the method search reaches object and the format_spec is non-empty$or if either the format_spec or the return value are not strings.@#,In all cases$if the optional parts are omitted$the code is executed in the current scope. If only globals is provided$it must be a dictionary (and not a subclass of dictionary)$which will be used for both the global and the local variables. If globals and locals are given$they are used for the global and local variables$respectively. If provided$locals can be any mapping object. Remember that at the module level$globals and locals are the same dictionary. If exec gets two separate objects as globals and locals$the code will be executed as if it were embedded in a class definition.
hash(object)$hash()$hash function,Return the hash value of the object (if it has one). Hash values are integers. They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup. Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value (even if they are of different types$as is the case for 1 and 1.0).@#,Returns the hash value of the object (if it has one).@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                         print(hash('Python'))  # Output: Hash value (integer)
hex(x)$hex()$hex function,Convert an integer number to a lowercase hexadecimal string prefixed with “0x”.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                    @#  >>print(hex(255))  # Output: '0xff',Convert an integer number to a lowercase hexadecimal string prefixed with “0x”.

Some examples:@#@#>>>@#hex(255)@#'0xff'@#hex(-42)@#'-0x2a'@#If you want to convert an integer number to an uppercase or lower hexadecimal string with prefix or not$you can use either of the following ways:@#@#>>>@#'%#x' % 255$'%x' % 255$'%X' % 255@#('0xff'$'ff'$'FF')@#format(255$'#x')$format(255$'x')$format(255$'X')@#('0xff'$'ff'$'FF')@#f'{255:#x}'$f'{255:x}'$f'{255:X}'@#('0xff'$'ff'$'FF')
input()$input(prompt)$input function,"Allows user input$optionally providing a prompt.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                       @#  >># name = input(""Enter your name: "")@#      # print(""Hello$"" + name)","If the prompt argument is present$it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input$converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline)$and returns that. When EOF is read$EOFError is raised.

isinstance()$isinstance function,@#Checks if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                      @#  >>print(isinstance(5$int))  # Output: True,Return True if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument$or of a (direct$indirect$or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type$the function always returns False. If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively$other such tuples) or a Union Type of multiple types$return True if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples$a TypeError exception is raised. TypeError may not be raised for an invalid type if an earlier check succeeds.
len(s)$len()$len function,Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string$bytes$tuple$list$or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary$set$or frozen set).,"Returns the length (the number of items) of an object.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                          print(len(""Hello""))  # Output: 5"
map()$map function,Return an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable$yielding the results. If additional iterables arguments are passed$function must take that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel. With multiple iterables$the iterator stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted. For cases where the function inputs are already arranged into argument tuples$see itertools.starmap().,Applies function to every item of iterable and returns a list of the results.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                    def square(x):@#    return x ** 2@#numbers = [1$2$3$4]@#result = map(square$numbers)@#print(list(result))  # Output: [1$4$9$16]
max()$max function,Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.@#If one positional argument is provided$it should be an iterable. The largest item in the iterable is returned. If two or more positional arguments are provided$the largest of the positional arguments is returned.@#There are two optional keyword-only arguments.

The two-argument form pow(base$exp) is equivalent to using the power operator: base**exp.@#@#The arguments must have numeric types. With mixed operand types$the coercion rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For int operands$the result has the same type as the operands (after coercion) unless the second argument is negative; in that case$all arguments are converted to float and a float result is delivered. For example$pow(10$2) returns 100$but pow(10$-2) returns 0.01. For a negative base of type int or float and a non-integral exponent$a complex result is delivered. For example$pow(-9$0.5) returns a value close to 3j.@#@#For int operands base and exp$if mod is present$mod must also be of integer type and mod must be nonzero. If mod is present and exp is negative$base must be relatively prime to mod.

If no objects are given$print() will just write end.@#@#The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None$sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings$print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these$use file.write(...) instead.@#@#Output buffering is usually determined by file. However$if flush is true$the stream is forcibly flushed.
round()$round function, Rounds a number to a specified number of digits.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                       @#  >>print(round(3.14159$2))  # Output: 3.14,Return number rounded to ndigits precision after the decimal point. If ndigits is omitted or is None$it returns the nearest integer to its input.@#@#For the built-in types supporting round()$values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits; if two multiples are equally close$rounding is done toward the even choice (so$for example$both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0$and round(1.5) is 2). Any integer value is valid for ndigits (positive$zero$or negative). The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None. Otherwise$the return value has the same type as number.@#@#For a general Python object number$round delegates to number.__round__.
sorted()$sorted function,Returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                 @#  >>print(sorted([3$1$4$1$5]$reverse=True))  # Output: [5$4$3$1$1],Return a new sorted list from the items in iterable.@#@#Has two optional arguments which must be specified as keyword arguments.@#@#key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in iterable (for example$key=str.lower). The default value is None (compare the elements directly).@#@#reverse is a boolean value. If set to True$then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed.@#@#Use functools.cmp_to_key() to convert an old-style cmp function to a key function.@#@#The built-in sorted() function is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example$sort by department$then by salary grade).@#@#The sort algorithm uses only < comparisons between items. While defining an __lt__() method will suffice for sorting$PEP 8 recommends that all six rich comparisons be implemented. This will help avoid bugs when using the same data with other ordering tools such as max() that rely on a different underlying method. Implementing all six comparisons also helps avoid confusion for mixed type comparisons which can call reflected the __gt__() method.
sum()$sum function, Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                     @#  >> print(sum([1$2$3$4$5]))  # Output: 15,Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. The iterable’s items are normally numbers$and the start value is not allowed to be a string.@#@#For some use cases$there are good alternatives to sum(). The preferred$fast way to concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling ''.join(sequence). To add floating point values with extended precision$see math.fsum(). To concatenate a series of iterables$consider using itertools.chain().
boolean operations, Operations that result in True or False$such as and$or$and not.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                      @#  >>print(True and False)  # Output: False@#      print(True or False)  # Output: True@#      print(not False)      # Output: True,In Python$boolean operations are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (True and False). There are three main boolean operators in Python: and$or$and not. Here's how each of them works:@#@#And: The And operator returns True if both operands are True$otherwise it returns False. It performs a logical AND operation.@#python@#@#True and True   # Output: True@#True and False  # Output: False@#False and True  # Output: False@#False and False # Output: False @#Or: The or operator returns True if at least one of the operands is True$otherwise it returns False. It performs a logical OR operation.@#python@#@#True or True    # Output: True@#True or False   # Output: True@#False or True   # Output: True@#False or False  # Output: False@#Not: The not operator returns the opposite boolean value of the operand. If the operand is True$not returns False$and vice versa.@#python@#@#not True   # Output: False@#not False  # Output: True
Comparisons,Compare two values using comparison operators like <$>$==$<=$>=$!=.@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                       @#  >>print(5 > 3)  # Output: True@#      print(5 == 5)  # Output: True,There are eight comparison operations in Python. They all have the same priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations). Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily; for example$x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z$except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).@#@#This table summarizes the comparison operations:@#Operation     Meaning@#<                  strictly less than@#<=               less than or equal@#>                 strictly greater than@#>=               greater than or equal@#==                       equal@#!=                    not equal@#is                   object identity@#is not        negated object identity
Numeric Types,Python's numeric data types include integers (int)$floating-point numbers (float)$and complex numbers (complex).@#Example:                                                                                                                                                                                      @#  >> a = 10    # int@#       b = 10.5  # float@#       c = 1+2j  # complex,There are three distinct numeric types: integers$floating point numbers$and complex numbers. In addition$Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers have unlimited precision. Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in sys.float_info. Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part$which are each a floating point number. To extract these parts from a complex number z$use z.real and z.imag. (The standard library includes the additional numeric types fractions.Fraction$for rationals$and decimal.Decimal$for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.)@#@#Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators.@#@#Operation     Result@#x + y             sum of x and @#yx - y           difference of x and y@#x * y             product of x and y@#x$y             quotient of x and y@#x // y         floored quotient of x and y@#x % y          remainder of x$y@#-x                 x negated@#+x                x unchanged@#abs(x)       absolute value or magnitude of x@#int(x)          x converted to integer@#float(x)     x converted to floating point@#complex(re$im)     a complex number with real part re$imaginary part im. im defaults to zero.@#c.conjugate()        conjugate of the complex number c@#divmod(x$y)         the pair (x // y$x % y)@#pow(x$y)               x to the power y@#x ** y                 x to the power y

Here are some key characteristics of lists:@#@#Mutable: Unlike tuples$lists are mutable$meaning their elements can be changed$added$or removed after the list is created.@#Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. This means that the elements of a list are accessed using integer indices starting from 0$and the order of elements remains fixed unless explicitly modified.@#Heterogeneous: Lists can contain elements of different data types$including integers$floats$strings$other lists$tuples$dictionaries$and more.@#Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets []$with elements separated by commas. Optionally$you can include square brackets around the elements for clarity$especially when defining empty lists or single-element lists.@#@#Here are some code examples:@#@## Creating lists@#empty_list = []@#single_element_list = [42]  # Single-element list@#list_with_elements = [1$2$3$'hello'$[4$5]]@#@## Accessing elements of a list@#print(list_with_elements[0])  # Output: 1@#print(list_with_elements[3])  # Output: 'hello'@#@## Lists are mutable@#list_with_elements[0] = 10  # Modify the first element@#print(list_with_elements)  # Output: [10$2$3$'hello'$[4$5]]@#@## Adding elements to a list@#list_with_elements.append('world')  # Append an element to the end@#print(list_with_elements)  # Output: [10$2$3$'hello'$[4$5]$'world']@#@## Removing elements from a list@#list_with_elements.remove(2)  # Remove the element 2@#print(list_with_elements)  # Output: [10$3$'hello'$[4$5]$'world']@#@## List concatenation@#concatenated_list = list_with_elements + [6$7]@#print(concatenated_list)  # Output: [10$3$'hello'$[4$5]$'world'$6$7]
sort()$sort function,The sort() method sorts the elements of a list in place. Optionally$it can take a key function to determine the sorting criteria and a reverse flag to specify the sorting order.,"In Python$the sort() method is used to sort the elements of a list in place. It modifies the original list and does not return a new list. The sort() method can be called on a list object and optionally accepts the following parameters:@#@#1)key (optional): A function that will be applied to each element to determine its sorting key. The elements are sorted based on the values returned by this function. If not specified$the elements are sorted based on their natural order.@#2)reverse (optional): A boolean value indicating whether the sorting should be in ascending order (reverse=False$default) or descending order (reverse=True).@#Here's the syntax of the sort() method:@#  >>list.sort(key=None$reverse=False)@#Here's a simple example to illustrate how the sort() method works:@#  >># Original list@#      numbers = [3$1$4$1$5$9$2$6$5$3$5]@#@#     # Sort the list in ascending order@#     numbers.sort()@#     print(""Sorted list (ascending):""$numbers)@#@#     # Sort the list in descending order@#     numbers.sort(reverse=True)@#     print(""Sorted list (descending):""$numbers)@#Output:@#  >>Sorted list (ascending): [1$1$2$3$3$4$5$5$5$6$9]@#      Sorted list (descending): [9$6$5$5$5$4$3$3$2$1$1]@#In this example$the sort() method is called on the numbers list to sort it in ascending order by default.

Mutable sets can be changed using methods like add() and remove()$while immutable sets cannot be altered after creation.@#@#Sets can be created using:@#@#A comma-separated list of elements within braces: {'a'$'b'$'c'}@#Set comprehension: {x for x in iterable if condition}@#The set() constructor: set(iterable)@#Sets support operations like:@#@#Membership testing: x in s@#Cardinality: len(s)@#Set comparisons: <=$<$>=$>@#Union: s.union(other)@#Intersection: s.intersection(other)@#Difference: s.difference(other)@#Symmetric difference: s.symmetric_difference(other)@#Mutable sets have additional methods for updating$adding$removing elements$and clearing the set.
Mapping Types,Mapping types in Python are mutable objects that associate hashable values with arbitrary objects. The primary mapping type is the dictionary$which allows you to create mappings using key-value pairs within braces or by using a dict comprehension. Dictionaries support various operations$including accessing$adding$and removing items$as well as methods for retrieving keys$values$and items. They also support methods like update() for merging dictionaries and clear() for removing all items. Additionally$dictionaries preserve insertion order and support reverse iteration.,Mapping types in Python are mutable objects that associate hashable values with arbitrary objects.

Methods,Methods are essentially functions that are accessed using the attribute notation. They come in two types: built-in methods$like append() for lists$and class instance methods. When you access a method through an instance$you get a bound method object. This object has two read-only attributes: m.__self__$which refers to the object the method operates on$and m.__func__$which refers to the function implementing the method. Calling m(arg1$arg2$...$argn) is the same as calling m.__func__(m.__self__$arg1$arg2$...$argn). Bound methods allow getting arbitrary attributes$but setting attributes directly on bound methods is not allowed. Instead$attributes should be set on the underlying function object.,Methods are essentially functions that are accessed using the attribute notation.

ArithmeticError$Arithmetic Error,The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various arithmetic errors: OverflowError$ ZeroDivisionError$ FloatingPointError.,The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various arithmetic errors: OverflowError$ ZeroDivisionError$ FloatingPointError.
buffer error,raised when the buffer related operation cannot be performed,A buffer error in Python typically occurs when there's an attempt to read or write beyond the bounds of a buffer$causing a buffer overflow or underflow. This can happen when dealing with data structures like lists$arrays$or strings$and it usually results from accessing memory locations that are outside the allocated space for the buffer.@#@#For example$consider a situation where you try to access an element at an index that doesn't exist in a list. This can lead to a buffer error because the index is out of range.@#@#Here's a simple example illustrating a buffer error:@#  >>my_list = [1$2$3]@#        print(my_list[5])  # Trying to access an index that doesn't exist@#Output:@#  >>IndexError: list index out of range@#To prevent buffer errors$always ensure that you're accessing valid indices or memory locations within the bounds of the buffer. This may involve checking the length of lists or arrays before accessing elements$validating user input$and using appropriate error handling mechanisms like try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
import error,raised when the import statements have troubles trying to load a module. Also raised when the “from list” in from ... import has a name that cannot be found.@#@#The optional name and path keyword-only arguments set the corresponding attributes:@#@#name@#The name of the module that was attempted to be imported.@#@#path@#The path to any file which triggered the exception.,raised when the import statements have troubles trying to load a module.

ModuleNotFound error,A subclass of import error which is raised by import when a module cannot be located,"The ""ModuleNotFoundError"" in Python occurs when the interpreter is unable to find the specified module during the import process. This error typically arises due to one of the following reasons:@#@#1)Incorrect Module Name: If you misspell the module name in the import statement$Python won't be able to find the module.Example:@#  >>import numpy  # Correct module name@#        import numy   # Incorrect module name@#2)Module Not Installed: If you're trying to import a third-party module that isn't installed in your Python environment$Python will raise a ModuleNotFoundError.Example:@#  >>import pandas  # Works if pandas is installed@#        import foo     # Raises ModuleNotFoundError if foo is not installed@#3)Module Path Issue: If the module is not in any of the directories specified in the Python's sys.path variable$Python won't be able to locate it.Example:@#  >>import my_module  # Works if my_module is in one of the directories in sys.path@#@#To resolve the ModuleNotFoundError$ensure that you:@#@#Spell the module name correctly in the import statement.@#Install the required module using a package manager like pip (pip install module_name).@#Check the module's path and move it to a directory listed in Python's sys.path variable if necessary."
index error,Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.,An IndexError in Python occurs when you try to access an index of a sequence (like a list$tuple$or string) that is out of range. This means you're trying to access an element at an index that doesn't exist in the sequence.@#@#Here's a simple example:@#  >>my_list = [1$2$3]@#        print(my_list[5])  # Trying to access index 5 which doesn't exist@#Output:@#  >>IndexError: list index out of range@#In this example$the list my_list only has three elements$so trying to access index 5 (which is beyond the range of valid indices) results in an IndexError.@#@#To prevent IndexError:@#@#1)Make sure you're accessing valid indices within the range of the sequence.@#2)Check the length of the sequence before accessing indices to avoid going out of range.@#3)Use try-except blocks to handle IndexError gracefully if you're unsure about the validity of the index.
name error, Raised when a local or global name is not found. This applies only to unqualified names. The associated value is an error message that includes the name that could not be found.@#@#The name attribute can be set using a keyword-only argument to the constructor. When set it represent the name of the variable that was attempted to be accessed., Raised when a local or global name is not found. This applies only to unqualified names. The associated value is an error message that includes the name that could not be found.@#@#The name attribute can be set using a keyword-only argument to the constructor. When set it represent the name of the variable that was attempted to be accessed.
overflow error,Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented. This cannot occur for integers (which would rather raise memory error thn give up) . However$for historical reasons$OverflowError is sometimes raised for integers that are outside a required range. Because of the lack of standardization of floating point exception handling in C$most floating point operations are not checked.,In Python$an OverflowError occurs when a calculation exceeds the maximum limit that can be represented by a numeric data type. This typically happens when performing arithmetic operations that result in a value larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the given data type.@#@#For example$consider the following code:@#  >>x = 10 ** 1000  # Attempting to calculate 10 to the power of 1000@#        print(x)@#Output:@#  >>OverflowError: int too large to convert to float@#In this example$attempting to calculate 10 to the power of 1000 results in an OverflowError because the resulting value is too large to be represented by the Python int type.@#@#Similarly$performing arithmetic operations that result in values outside the range of a given numeric type can also raise OverflowError. For example$adding two very large numbers together or dividing by zero in certain cases can lead to an OverflowError.@#@#To prevent OverflowError:@#@#1)Use appropriate data types or libraries that support arbitrary precision arithmetic for handling very large numbers.@#2)Check for potential overflow conditions and handle them gracefully in your code$such as by using try-except blocks to catch and handle OverflowError.
file exists error,Raised when trying to create a file or directory which already exists.,"In Python$a FileExistsError is raised when attempting to create a file or directory that already exists. This error typically occurs when using functions or methods that create files or directories$such as open() for file creation or os.makedirs() for directory creation$in situations where the specified file or directory already exists in the file system.@#@#For example$consider the following code:@#  >>with open(""myfile.txt""$""x"") as f:@#                f.write(""Hello$world!"")@#If myfile.txt already exists in the current directory$attempting to create it again with the ""x"" mode (exclusive creation) will raise a FileExistsError because the file cannot be created if it already exists.@#@#To handle FileExistsError$you can:@#@#Check if the file or directory already exists before attempting to create it.@#Use appropriate file opening or directory creation modes that allow for existing files or directories to be overwritten or ignored$depending on your specific requirements.@#Use try-except blocks to catch and handle FileExistsError exceptions gracefully in your code."
file not found,Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesn’t exist.,"In Python$a FileNotFoundError is raised when attempting to access or open a file that does not exist in the specified location. This error typically occurs when using functions or methods that require accessing files$such as open() for file reading or os.remove() for file deletion$but the specified file path does not point to an existing file.@#@#For example$consider the following code:@#  >>with open(""myfile.txt""$""r"") as f:@#           content = f.read()@#If myfile.txt does not exist in the current directory$attempting to open it for reading (""r"" mode) will raise a FileNotFoundError because the file cannot be found at the specified path.@#@#To handle FileNotFoundError$you can:@#@#Ensure that the file path is correct and points to the intended file.@#Check if the file exists before attempting to access it using functions like os.path.exists() or os.path.isfile().@#Use try-except blocks to catch and handle FileNotFoundError exceptions gracefully in your code$providing appropriate error messages or fallback behaviors for when the file is not found."
 syntax warning,Base class for warnings about dubious syntax.,"In Python$a SyntaxWarning is issued by the interpreter when it encounters a dubious or potentially incorrect syntax construct in the code. Unlike other exceptions or errors$SyntaxWarning does not typically halt the execution of the program$but it serves as an indicator of potential issues in the code.@#@#SyntaxWarning often occurs in situations where the code follows syntactic conventions that are not recommended or are considered non-standard$but they are technically valid according to the Python language specifications. These warnings are intended to draw attention to code that might be confusing or lead to unexpected behavior.@#@#For example$using the <> operator for inequality instead of !=:@#  >># Deprecated syntax for inequality@#        if x <> y:@#               print(""x is not equal to y"")@#This would generate a SyntaxWarning because <> is deprecated and != is the preferred way to express inequality in Python.@#@#To handle SyntaxWarning:@#@#Review the code to identify and correct any syntax constructs that might trigger SyntaxWarning.@#Pay attention to any warnings issued by the interpreter during code execution or use tools like static code analyzers to detect potential issues.@#Suppress or ignore SyntaxWarning if you are intentionally using non-standard syntax and are aware of its implications. However$it's generally recommended to adhere to standard Python syntax conventions to ensure code clarity and maintainability."

Variable$stored value$variables,Variables in Python:@#@#Variables in Python are names that represent values stored in memory. They can hold different types of data$and you can assign and reassign values to them. Python is dynamically typed$so you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.,"In Python$a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory. Here's a breakdown of how variables work in Python:@#@#1)Assigning Values: You can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the assignment operator (=). For example:@#  >>x = 5@#2)Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed$meaning that you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The type of the variable is determined based on the value assigned to it. For example:@#  >>x = 5   # x is an integer@#      y = ""Hello""  # y is a string@#3)Naming Rules: Variable names in Python can contain letters (a-z$A-Z)$digits (0-9)$and underscores (_) but cannot start with a digit. They are case-sensitive$so myVar and myvar are different variables.@#4)Reassigning Values: You can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. For example:@#  >>x = 5@#      x = 10  # Reassigning x to a new value@#5)Memory Allocation: When you assign a value to a variable$Python allocates memory to store that value. Variables act as references to the memory locations where the values are stored.@#6)Immutable vs. Mutable Types: In Python$variables can hold both immutable and mutable types of data:@#Immutable types$such as integers$floats$strings$and tuples$cannot be changed after they are created. When you modify the value of an immutable variable$Python creates a new object in memory.@#Mutable types$such as lists$dictionaries$and sets$can be modified after they are created. When you modify the value of a mutable variable$Python updates the existing object in memory without creating a new one.@#Here's an example demonstrating the use of variables in Python:@#  >># Assigning values to variables@#        x = 5@#        y = ""Hello""@#      # Reassigning values@#        x = 10@#      # Printing variables@#        print(x)  # Output: 10@#        print(y)  # Output: Hello@#In this example$x and y are variables holding the values 10 and ""Hello""$respectively. You can use these variables to store and manipulate data throughout your Python code."
data types,Data types in Python:@#@#Data types in Python represent the kind of data a variable can hold$such as numbers$strings$lists$dictionaries$and more. Python is dynamically typed$so you don't need to specify the data type explicitly when defining a variable. Each data type has specific properties and operations that can be performed on it.,"In Python$data types represent the type of data that can be stored and manipulated in variables. Here are some common data types in Python:@#@#1)Numeric Types:@#      int: Represents integers$whole numbers without any decimal point.@#      float: Represents floating-point numbers$numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form (e.g.$3.14$2.0e3).@#2)Sequence Types:@#      str: Represents strings$sequences of characters enclosed within single (' ')$double ("" "")$or triple (''' ''' or """""" """""") quotes.@#      list: Represents lists$ordered collections of items enclosed within square brackets ([])$which can contain elements of different data types and can be modified (mutable).@#      tuple: Represents tuples$ordered collections of items enclosed within parentheses (())$similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified).@#3)Mapping Type:@#      dict: Represents dictionaries$unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces ({}) where each key is associated with a value.@#4)Set Types:@#      set: Represents sets$unordered collections of unique elements enclosed within curly braces ({}) without any duplicate values.@#      frozenset: Represents immutable sets$similar to sets but cannot be modified after creation.@#5)Boolean Type:@#      bool: Represents Boolean values$either True or False$used for logical operations and comparisons.@#6)None Type:@#      NoneType: Represents the absence of a value or a null value$denoted by the keyword None.@#Python is dynamically typed$meaning that you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The data type of a variable is determined based on the value assigned to it. For example:@# >>x = 5        # x is an int@#     y = 3.14     # y is a float@#     name = 'John'  # name is a str@#     my_list = [1$2$3]  # my_list is a list@#@#You can use built-in functions like type() to determine the data type of a variable. Understanding data types is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free Python code as it determines how you can manipulate and operate on your data."

input$read input ,To read input from the user in Python$you use the input() function. It prompts the user to enter something$returns what the user types as a string$and you can assign it to a variable for further use.,"In Python$you can read input from the user using the input() function. Here's how it works:@#  >>user_input = input(""Enter something: "")@#1)Prompt: The input() function takes an optional string argument$called the prompt$which is displayed to the user before they enter their input. This prompt is used to provide instructions or ask for information.@#2)User Input: When the input() function is called$the program waits for the user to type something and press Enter. Whatever the user enters is treated as a string and returned by the input() function.@#3)Assigning to a Variable: You can assign the input value returned by input() to a variable$as shown in the example above. This allows you to store and manipulate the user's input within your Python code.@#Here's a complete example:@#  >>name = input(""Enter your name: "")@#      print(""Hello$"" + name + ""!"")@#In this example$the program prompts the user to enter their name. Whatever the user types is stored in the variable name. Then$the program prints a greeting message using the user's name.@#It's important to note that the input() function always returns a string$so if you need to work with numeric values$you'll need to convert the input using functions like int() or float():@#  >>age = int(input(""Enter your age: ""))@#This would convert the user's input to an integer before storing it in the variable age."
mathematical operations$math operations,In Python$mathematical expressions involve using operators like addition (+)$subtraction (-)$multiplication (*)$division (/)$integer division (//)$modulo (%)$and exponentiation (**). These operators allow you to perform arithmetic operations on numeric values. You can also use parentheses to control the order of operations.,In Python$mathematical expressions are used to perform arithmetic operations on numeric values. Here are some common arithmetic operators used in mathematical expressions:@#@#1)Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.@#  >>result = 10 + 5  # result is 15@#2)Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.@#  >>result = 10 - 5  # result is 5@#3)Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers together.@#  >>result = 10 * 5  # result is 50@#4)Division (/): Divides one number by another. Always returns a floating-point number.@#  >>result = 10$5  # result is 2.0@#5)Integer Division (//): Divides one number by another and returns the integer part of the result.@#  >>result = 10 // 3  # result is 3@#6)Modulo (%): Returns the remainder of the division of one number by another.@#  >>result = 10 % 3  # result is 1@#7)Exponentiation (**): Raises one number to the power of another.@#  >>result = 2 ** 3  # result is 8@#@#You can use parentheses to control the order of operations in complex expressions$just like in standard mathematics:@#  >>result = (10 + 5) * 2  # result is 30@#It's important to note that Python follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)$where Parentheses have the highest precedence$followed by Exponents$Multiplication and Division (from left to right)$and finally Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).@#Here's a simple example combining multiple operators:@#  >>result = 10 + 5 * 2  # result is 20$multiplication is performed before addition@#@#These mathematical expressions can be used in various scenarios$such as calculations$algorithms$and data manipulation$to perform arithmetic operations and compute numerical results.
string concatenation$concatenation,String concatenation in Python involves combining two or more strings together using the + operator. You can concatenate strings by simply placing them next to each other or by adding other characters$like spaces or punctuation$between them.,"String concatenation in Python refers to the process of combining two or more strings together to create a single string. You can concatenate strings using the + operator or by using string formatting methods. Here's how it works:@#@#Using the ""+"" Operator:@#  >>str1 = ""Hello""@#        str2 = ""World""@#        result = str1 + "" "" + str2  # Concatenating str1$a space$and str2@#        print(result)  # Output: Hello World"
escape characters$escape character,Escape characters in Python are special characters preceded by a backslash (\) that are used to represent characters that are difficult to type directly into a string. Common examples include \n for a newline$\t for a tab$and \\ to represent a backslash itself. They help in formatting strings and including special characters within strings.,"Escape characters in Python are special characters preceded by a backslash (\) that are used to represent characters that are difficult or impossible to type directly into a string. They are used to perform various formatting tasks within strings. Here are some common escape characters in Python:@#@#1)\n: Represents a newline character.

Here's how it works:@#@#1)Syntax: To create an f-string$prefix the string literal with the letter 'f' or 'F'$followed by the expression or variable enclosed within curly braces {}.@#2)Embedding Variables: You can directly embed variables and expressions within f-strings to include their values in the resulting string.@#  >>name = ""Alice""@#      age = 30@#      result = f""My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.""@#      print(result)  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.@#3)Expression Evaluation: Expressions within f-strings are evaluated at runtime$allowing you to perform calculations or call functions directly within the string.@#  >>num1 = 10@#      num2 = 20@#      result = f""The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}.""@#      print(result)  # Output: The sum of 10 and 20 is 30.@#4)Formatting Options: You can also apply formatting options to the embedded values within f-strings to control the appearance of the output$such as specifying the number of decimal places for floating-point numbers or padding numeric values with zeros.@#  >>price = 19.99@#      result = f""The price is ${price:.2f}""@#      print(result)  # Output: The price is $19.99@#F-strings provide a convenient and expressive way to create formatted strings in Python$making code more readable and reducing the need for complex string concatenation or formatting operations. They are available in Python 3.6 and later versions."
logical operators,Logical operators (and$or$not) in Python are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values. and returns True if both operands are True$or returns True if at least one operand is True$and not returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand. They are commonly used in conditional statements and boolean expressions to control program flow based on conditions.,"Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False). There are three main logical operators in Python: and$or$and not. Here's how each one works:@#@#1)And Operator: Returns True if both operands are True$otherwise returns False.@#  >>result = True and False  # False@#2)or Operator: Returns True if at least one of the operands is True$otherwise returns False.@#  >>result = True or False  # True@#3)not Operator: Returns the opposite of the operand's Boolean value. If the operand is True$not returns False. If the operand is False$not returns True.@#  >>result = not True  # False@#These logical operators are often used in conditional statements (if$elif$else) and boolean expressions to control the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions.@#  >>x = 5@#      y = 10@#      if x > 0 and y > 0:@#           print(""Both x and y are positive"")@#     elif x > 0 or y > 0:@#           print(""At least one of x or y is positive"")@#In this example$and is used to check if both x and y are positive$while or is used to check if at least one of x or y is positive. Logical operators are essential for writing conditional statements and boolean expressions to make decisions in Python programs."
while statement$while loop$while looping$while iteration,The while loop in Python executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains True. It starts with the while keyword followed by a condition. The code block is executed as long as the condition evaluates to True$and the condition is re-evaluated after each iteration.,The while loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is True. Here's how it works:@#@#1)Syntax: The while loop starts with the while keyword$followed by a condition. The code block to be executed is indented below the while statement.@#  >>while condition:@#        # code block@#2)Condition: The condition is a boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue iterating. If the condition evaluates to True$the code block inside the loop is executed. If the condition evaluates to False$the loop terminates$and the program continues executing the code after the loop.@#3)Iterating: Inside the loop$the code block is executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains True. After each iteration$the condition is re-evaluated. If the condition is still True$the loop continues to execute. If the condition becomes False at any point$the loop terminates$and control passes to the next statement after the loop.@#Example:@#  >>count = 0@#      while count < 5:@#           print(count)@#           count += 1@#This loop prints numbers from 0 to 4. The count variable starts at 0$and the loop continues executing as long as count is less than 5. Inside the loop$the current value of count is printed$and then count is incremented by 1. Once count reaches 5$the condition count < 5 becomes False$and the loop terminates.@#while loops are useful when you need to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. However$you should be cautious to ensure that the condition eventually becomes False to prevent infinite loops$which can cause your program to hang or become unresponsive.
infinite loop$infinite recursion,An infinite loop or recursion in Python occurs when a loop continues to execute indefinitely without ever terminating. This can happen due to missing or incorrect exit conditions$or if the exit condition is not being updated within the loop. Infinite loops can cause your program to hang or become unresponsive.,"An infinite loop or recursion in Python is a loop that continues to execute indefinitely without ever terminating. This situation occurs when the loop's exit condition is never met or when the loop's exit condition is not properly defined. Here's how infinite loops can happen:@#@#1)Missing or Incorrect Exit Condition: If the exit condition of a loop is not properly defined or if it's missing altogether$the loop will continue executing indefinitely.@#  >># Infinite loop: Missing exit condition@#      while True:@#           print(""This is an infinite loop"")@#2)Exit Condition Not Being Updated: Even if an exit condition is defined initially$if it's not being updated within the loop$the loop may continue to execute indefinitely.@#  >># Infinite loop: Exit condition not being updated@#       count = 0@#       while count < 5:@#            print(""This is an infinite loop"")@#3)Incorrect Logic: Incorrect logic within the loop can also lead to infinite loops. For example$if the logic for updating a loop variable or condition is incorrect$the loop may not terminate as expected.@#  >># Infinite loop: Incorrect logic for updating loop variable@#       count = 0@#       while count < 5:@#            print(count)@#       # Incorrect logic: Count never gets updated$loop continues indefinitely@#Infinite loops can cause your program to hang or become unresponsive$as it keeps executing the same code repeatedly without making progress. To avoid infinite loops$ensure that the exit condition of your loops is properly defined and updated within the loop's code block. Additionally$be cautious when using constructs like while True$and make sure there's a clear termination condition."
assignment operators$augmented operators,Augmented assignment operators in Python are shortcuts for performing arithmetic or bitwise operations while simultaneously assigning the result back to a variable. They combine an operator (like +=$-=$*=$etc.) with the assignment operator (=) to update the variable's value in-place.,Augmented assignment operators in Python are shorthand notation for performing arithmetic or bitwise operations while simultaneously assigning the result back to the variable. They combine an arithmetic or bitwise operator with the assignment operator (=). Here are some common augmented assignment operators:@#@#1)+=: Adds the value of the right operand to the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.@#  >>x += 5  # Equivalent to: x = x + 5@#2)-=: Subtracts the value of the right operand from the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.@#  >>x -= 3  # Equivalent to: x = x - 3@#3)*=: Multiplies the variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result back to the variable.@#  >>x *= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x * 2@#4)/=: Divides the variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result back to the variable.@#  >>x /= 4  # Equivalent to: x = x$4@#5)%=: Performs the modulo operation on the variable with the value of the right operand and assigns the remainder back to the variable@#  >>x %= 3  # Equivalent to: x = x % 3@#6)//=: Performs integer division on the variable with the value of the right operand and assigns the quotient back to the variable.@#  >>x //= 2  # Equivalent to: x = x // 2@#7)**=: Raises the variable to the power of the value of the right operand and assigns the result back to the variable.@#  >>x **= 3  # Equivalent to: x = x ** 3@#8)&=$|=: Performs bitwise AND or OR operation on the variable with the value of the right operand and assigns the result back to the variable.@#  >>x &= 0b1010  # Equivalent to: x = x & 0b1010@#      x |= 0b1100  # Equivalent to: x = x | 0b1100@#Augmented assignment operators are concise and efficient ways to update variables by performing operations in-place. They can improve code readability and reduce redundancy$especially when multiple operations are performed on the same variable.
nested loops$nested loop,Nested loops in Python are loops within loops. They allow you to iterate over elements in multiple dimensions or perform repetitive tasks hierarchically. The inner loop executes completely for each iteration of the outer loop.,"Nested loops in Python refer to the situation where you have one loop inside another loop. This allows you to iterate over elements in multiple dimensions or to perform repetitive tasks in a hierarchical manner. Here's how they work:@#@#1)Syntax: In Python$you can place one loop inside another by indenting the inner loop within the block of the outer loop.@#  >>for outer_item in outer_sequence:@#               for inner_item in inner_sequence:@#                 # Code block@#2)Execution: The outer loop executes first$and for each iteration of the outer loop$the inner loop executes completely. This means that the inner loop iterates through all its elements for each iteration of the outer loop.@#Example:@#  >>for i in range(3):@#          for j in range(2):@#                print(f""({i}${j})"")@#This code will produce the following output:@#(0$0)@#(0$1)@#(1$0)@#(1$1)@#(2$0)@#(2$1)@#In this example$the outer loop iterates over the values 0$1$and 2$while the inner loop iterates over the values 0 and 1 for each value of the outer loop.@#Nested loops are commonly used when dealing with multi-dimensional data structures like matrices or nested lists$or when performing repetitive tasks that involve multiple levels of iteration. However$it's important to be cautious with nested loops$as they can result in increased complexity and execution time$especially for large data sets."
void function,"A ""void function"" in Python is a function that doesn't return any value or explicitly returns None. It typically performs an action or task but doesn't produce a result that can be used elsewhere in the code.","In Python$a ""void function"" is a term that is not commonly used. However$it likely refers to a function that doesn't return any value$or more precisely$returns the value None. In Python$functions that don't have a return statement or have a return statement without a value explicitly specified return None by default.@#@#Here's an example of a void function:@#  >>def greet(name):@#           print(f""Hello${name}!"")@#          result = greet(""Alice"")@#          print(result)  # Output: None@#In this example$the greet function prints a greeting message but doesn't explicitly return any value. When we assign the result of calling greet(""Alice"") to a variable and print it$we get None$indicating that the function returned nothing.@#@#So$in summary$a ""void function"" in Python typically refers to a function that doesn't return any meaningful value$but rather performs some action or task."
value returning function$value-returning function,A value-returning function in Python is a function that calculates a result and returns it to the caller using the return statement. It produces a value that can be assigned to a variable or used in expressions elsewhere in the program.,A value-returning function in Python is a function that calculates and returns a result or value to the caller. Unlike void functions$which perform actions without returning a value$value-returning functions produce a result that can be used in the program.@#@#Here's an example of a value-returning function:@#  >>def add(a$b):@#           return a + b@#result = add(3$5)@#print(result)  # Output: 8@#In this example$the add function takes two arguments a and b$adds them together using the + operator$and returns the result using the return statement. When we call add(3$5)$it returns 8$which is then assigned to the variable result and printed.@#@#Value-returning functions are commonly used in Python to perform calculations$process data$or perform any operation that needs to produce a result that can be used elsewhere in the program.
local variable$local variables,In Python$a local variable is a variable defined within a function's scope$accessible only within that function. It exists only during the function's execution and cannot be accessed from outside the function.,In Python$a local variable is a variable defined within a function$which can only be accessed within that function's scope. Local variables are created when a function is called$and they exist only for the duration of that function's execution. Here are some key points about local variables:@#@#1)Scope: Local variables have local scope$meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined. They cannot be accessed from outside the function.@#2)Lifetime: Local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits. They do not persist beyond the function's execution.@#3)Name Conflicts: Local variables can have the same name as variables in other functions or in the global scope without causing conflicts. Each function's local variables are independent of variables with the same name in other functions.@#Example:@#  >>def my_function():@#              x = 10  # Local variable@#              print(x)@#my_function()  # Output: 10@## print(x)  # This would cause a NameError: name 'x' is not defined@#In this example$x is a local variable defined within the my_function() function. It can only be accessed within the function.@#@#Local variables provide encapsulation and help organize code by keeping data separate and accessible only to the functions that need it. They also prevent unintended modifications of variables in other parts of the program.
keyword arguments$keyword argument,Keyword arguments in Python allow you to pass arguments to a function using parameter names. This provides clarity$flexibility$and allows you to specify only the arguments you need$especially useful for functions with many parameters.,"In Python$keyword arguments allow you to specify arguments to a function using the parameter names along with their corresponding values. This provides clarity and flexibility$especially when dealing with functions that have many parameters or when you want to pass arguments in a different order than they are defined.@#@#Here's a basic example:@#  >>def greet(name$message):@#              print(f""Hello${name}! {message}"")@#           # Calling the function using positional arguments@#       greet(""Alice""$""How are you?"")@#@#               # Calling the function using keyword arguments@#             greet(message=""How are you?""$name=""Bob"")@#In the first call$""Alice"" is passed as the name argument and ""How are you?"" as the message argument. In the second call$the arguments are passed in a different order$but because they are explicitly named$Python can still match them correctly.@#@#Keyword arguments become particularly useful when functions have many parameters and you only want to specify a few of them$or when you want to make your code more readable by explicitly stating what each argument represents.@#@#You can also set default values for parameters$which further enhances the flexibility of keyword arguments:@#  >>def greet(name$message=""How are you?""):@#                   print(f""Hello${name}! {message}"")@#       # Now$you can call greet with just the name@#       greet(""Alice"")@#      # Or with both name and message@#      greet(""Bob""$""Nice to see you!"")@#In this example$if you call greet(""Alice"")$it will print ""Hello$Alice! How are you?"" because the default value for message is used. But if you call greet(""Bob""$""Nice to see you!"")$it will print ""Hello$Bob! Nice to see you!""$overriding the default value for message."
default argument$default arguments,Default argument values in Python allow you to set a default value for a function parameter. If no value is provided when the function is called$it uses this default value$making the parameter optional.,"In Python$default argument values allow you to set a default value for a function parameter. If an argument isn't provided when the function is called$it uses this default value. This feature enhances flexibility$making certain parameters optional. Here's a quick example:@#  >>def greet(name$message=""How are you?""):@#               print(f""Hello${name}! {message}"")  @#        # You can call greet with just the name@#        greet(""Alice"")@#        # Or with both name and message@#        greet(""Bob""$""Nice to see you!"")@#In this code$message has a default value of ""How are you?"". When you call greet(""Alice"")$it prints ""Hello$Alice! How are you?"" because message defaults to its default value. But when you call greet(""Bob""$""Nice to see you!"")$it prints ""Hello$Bob! Nice to see you!""$overriding the default value for message."
open file&open files,"To open a file in Python$you use the open() function$specifying the file name and the mode (""r"" for read$""w"" for write$""a"" for append). After you're done$it's important to close the file using file.close() or use a context manager (with open() as file:) to automatically handle closing.","In Python$you can open a file using the built-in open() function.

You can specify the file path if it's not in the same directory as your Python script.@#""r"" specifies the mode in which the file is opened. ""r"" stands for read mode$which allows you to read the contents of the file. Other common modes include ""w"" for write mode (creating a new file or overwriting an existing one) and ""a"" for append mode (appending data to the end of an existing file).@#After you've finished working with the file$it's important to close it using the close() method to free up system resources.@#@#Alternatively$you can use a context manager (with statement) to automatically close the file when you're done:@#  >>with open(""example.txt""$""r"") as file:@#         contents = file.read()@#Using a context manager ensures that the file is closed properly$even if an exception occurs within the with block."
file modes,"Sure! In Python$file modes indicate how you want to interact with a file. ""r"" is for reading$""w"" for writing (truncates existing content)$""a"" for appending$""b"" for binary mode$and ""t"" for text mode (default). You can combine modes$like ""rb"" for reading a binary file.","In Python$when opening a file using the open() function$you can specify different modes to indicate how you intend to interact with the file. Here are the main modes:@#@#1)""r"": Read mode. Opens the file for reading. If the file doesn't exist$it raises a FileNotFoundError.@#2)""w"": Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists$it truncates (clears) its content. If it doesn't exist$it creates a new file.@#3)""a"": Append mode. Opens the file for writing$but appends new data to the end of the file without truncating existing content. If the file doesn't exist$it creates a new file.@#4)""b"": Binary mode. Opens the file in binary mode$which is used when working with non-text files like images or executable files. It can be combined with other modes$like ""rb"" for reading binary files.@#5)""t"": Text mode (default). Opens the file in text mode$which is used for working with text files.

It doesn't return a new list; instead$it directly alters the existing list.@#@#You can also reverse a list using slicing$which creates a new reversed list:@#  >>my_list = [1$2$3$4]@#      reversed_list = my_list[::-1]@#      print(reversed_list)  # Output: [4$3$2$1]@#However$this creates a new list object$while reverse() operates directly on the original list.@#@#Remember$if you want to iterate over a list in reverse order without modifying the original list$you can use the reversed() function or a reversed loop.
delete statement$del statement$del,In Python$the del statement removes elements from a list. Use del my_list[index] to remove a specific element at index$or del my_list[start:end] to remove a slice of elements. It modifies the original list in place.,In Python$the del statement is used to remove an element or a slice of elements from a list. Here's a basic example:@#  >>my_list = [1$2$3$4$5]@#      del my_list[2]  # Removes the element at index 2@#      print(my_list)  # Output: [1$2$4$5]@#      del my_list[1:3]  # Removes elements from index 1 to 2 (excluding 3)@#      print(my_list)  # Output: [1$5]@#In this example:@#  >>del my_list[2] removes the element at index 2 (value 3) from my_list.@#      del my_list[1:3] removes elements from index 1 to 2 (excluding index 3)$which are values 2 and 4.@#The del statement modifies the original list in place. It's useful when you want to remove specific elements from a list$including single elements or slices.@#@#Additionally$you can use del to delete the entire list:@#  >>my_list = [1$2$3]@#      del my_list  # Deletes the entire list@#After executing del my_list$my_list will no longer exist$and trying to access it will raise a NameError.
list copying$copy list,In Python$copying a list creates a new list with the same elements. Shallow copy retains references to original elements$while deep copy creates entirely new copies. Shallow: new_list = old_list[:]$new_list = list(old_list)$new_list = old_list.copy(). Deep: import copy; new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list).,In Python$list copying refers to creating a new list that contains the same elements as another list. There are two main methods for copying lists: shallow copy and deep copy.@#@#1)Shallow Copy:@#A shallow copy creates a new list object$but it only copies the references to the original elements of the list. If the elements are mutable objects (like lists themselves)$changes made to those mutable objects in the new list will affect the original list and vice versa.@#Shallow copying can be done using slicing$the copy() method$or the list() constructor.@#2)Deep Copy:@#     A deep copy creates a completely new list object and recursively copies all the elements and nested elements of the original list. Changes made to elements in the new list will not affect the original list$and vice versa.@#     Deep copying is performed using the copy.deepcopy() function from the copy module.@#     Here are some examples:@#  >># Shallow copy examples@#        original_list = [1$2$[3$4]]@#        shallow_copy = original_list[:]  # Using slicing@#        shallow_copy[2].append(5)  # Modifying a nested list@#        print(original_list)  # Output: [1$2$[3$4$5]]@#        import copy@#        shallow_copy = copy.copy(original_list)  # Using copy()@#        shallow_copy[2].append(6)@#        print(original_list)  # Output: [1$2$[3$4$5$6]]@#@#        shallow_copy = list(original_list)  # Using list() constructor@#        shallow_copy[2].append(7)@#        print(original_list)  # Output: [1$2$[3$4$5$6$7]]@#@#       # Deep copy example@#       import copy@#       original_list = [1$2$[3$4]]@#       deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)@#       deep_copy[2].append(5)@#       print(original_list)  # Output: [1$2$[3$4]]@#In summary$when copying lists$shallow copy retains references to the original list's elements$while deep copy creates entirely new copies of all nested elements$ensuring independence between the original and copied lists.

and operator,The and operator is used to combine two or more conditions. The overall expression is only True if all individual conditions are True. Otherwise$the expression is False.,The and operator is used to combine two or more conditions in a logical expression. It evaluates each condition from left to right. The overall expression is only considered True if all individual conditions evaluate to True. If any condition evaluates to False$the entire expression becomes False$and the evaluation stops without checking the remaining conditions. This behavior is known as short-circuit evaluation$as Python optimizes the process by stopping as soon as it knows the overall outcome.
and operator, Evaluates as True if both operands are true.,In a statement like if a and b:$both a and b must be true for the statement to execute. For example$if a = True and b = True$then a and b results in True.
or operator, Evaluates as True if at least one operand is true.,Used to check multiple conditions where only one needs to be true. For example$if a or b: will execute if either a or b is true.
not operator,Inverts the boolean value of the operand.,Useful in conditions where you want to execute code when a condition is not met. For example$if not a: executes if a is False.
write mode$'w' mode,Opens a file for writing$truncating the file first.,Use this mode to write data to a file$removing any existing data within the file. Example: file = open('example.txt'$'w').
read mode$'r' mode,Opens a file for reading.,This mode allows you to read data from a file without modifying it. Example: file = open('example.txt'$'r').
append mode$'a' mode,Opens a file for writing$appending new data at the end of the file.,Use this to add data to the end of the file without removing existing data. Example: file = open('log.txt'$'a').
lower()$lower function$lower method,Converts all uppercase letters in a string to lowercase.,"Useful when you need to make string comparisons without case sensitivity. Example: name = ""ALICE"".lower() results in ""alice""."
upper()$upper function$lower function,Converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase.,"Often used in user interfaces where consistency in text display is needed. Example: status = ""active"".upper() results in ""ACTIVE""."
strip()$strip function$strip method, Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.,"This is particularly useful when processing user input or data parsed from files. Example: user_input = "" hello "".strip() results in ""hello""."
split()$split function$split method,Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.," Commonly used to parse data. For example$data = ""apple$banana$cherry"".split('$') results in [""apple""$""banana""$""cherry""]."
join()$join function$join method,Concatenates a list of strings into a single string with a delimiter.,"Useful for combining multiple strings with a specific separator. Example: words = ['Hello'$'World']; sentence = ' '.join(words) results in ""Hello World""."
replace()$replace function$replace method,Replaces occurrences of a substring within a string with another substring.,"This method can be used to sanitize or modify text. Example: text = ""Hello there"".replace('there'$'world') results in ""Hello world""."
substr()$substr function$substr method,Not a standard Python method but typically refers to obtaining a substring.," In Python$you'd use slicing instead. Example: text = ""Hello world""[1:5] results in ""ello""."
complex type$imaginary type$imaginary numbers$imaginary number,The complex type in programming handles complex numbers$with the imaginary type focusing on the imaginary part. Imaginary numbers$involving the imaginary unit (i)$are crucial in math and science. An imaginary number is a type of complex number in the form bi$where b is real and i is the imaginary unit.,the complex type in programming deals with complex numbers$where the imaginary type specifically represents the imaginary part of a complex number. Imaginary numbers are a mathematical concept involving the imaginary unit$@#𝑖@#i$and they play a significant role in various mathematical and scientific fields. An imaginary number is a specific type of complex number of the form @#𝑏@#𝑖@#bi$where @#𝑏@#b is a real number and @#𝑖@#i is the imaginary unit.
< operator$less than operator,Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.,Commonly used in conditional statements and loops. For example$if 5 < 10: evaluates as True because 5 is less than 10.
> operator$greater than operator,Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.,Used to compare numeric values typically in control flow structures. Example: if 10 > 5: evaluates as True indicating 10 is greater than 5.
operator ==$equality operator$is equal operator,Compares two values for equality.,Determines if two values are equivalent. For example$if a == b: checks if a is equal to b.
<= operator$less than or equal operator,Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.,Often used in loop conditions or validations. Example: if age <= 18: permits actions for ages 18 and below.
>= operator$greater than or equal operator,Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.,Useful in scenarios where thresholds need to be established. Example: if score >= 50: passes if score is 50 or more.
!= operator$not equal operator$not equality operator,Checks if two values are not equal.,Used to execute code when two values do not match. Example: if x != y: runs if x and y are different.
operator +$addition operator,Adds two numbers or concatenates strings.,In addition to numerical addition$it can concatenate strings or lists. Example: result = 'Hello ' + 'World' results in 'Hello World'.
operator -$subtraction operator,Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.,Used for arithmetic operations. Example: difference = 10 - 5 results in 5.
* operator$multiplication operator$times operator,Multiplies two numbers.,Can also be used to repeat sequences. Example: text = 'Hello' * 3 results in 'HelloHelloHello'.
** operator$power operator$exponent operator,Raises the base to the power of the exponent., Used for power calculations. Example: result = 2 ** 3 calculates as 8.
/ operator$division operator$divide operator,Divides the left operand by the right operand., Performs floating-point division. Example: result = 10 / 3 approximates to 3.3333.
// operator$int division operator$int divide operator,Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer.,Useful for obtaining whole numbers in division. Example: result = 10 // 3 results in 3.
% operator$mod operator$modulus operator,Returns the remainder of a division.,Commonly used to check divisibility or as a counter in loops. Example: if x % 2 == 0: checks if x is even.
<< operator$Left Shift Operator,Shifts bits of the left operand to the left.,Multiples the number by two for each shift. Example: result = 1 << 2 results in 4 (bitwise shift of 1 two places to the left).
>> operator$Right Shift Operator,Shifts bits of the left operand to the right.,Divides the number by two for each shift$disregarding any fractions. Example: result = 4 >> 2 results in 1.
& operator$Bitwise AND Operator,Applies the AND operation on each pair of bits.,result = 5 & 3 evaluates to 1 because in binary$5 is 101 and 3 is 011; only the lowest bit is 1 in both.
| operator$Bitwise OR Operator,The | operator performs a bitwise OR operation$comparing each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If either bit is 1$the corresponding result bit is set to 1.,This operator is often used in contexts where flags represented as bits need to be combined. For example$if you have a = 0b1010 and b = 0b1100$then a | b would result in 0b1110$combining the flags.
^ operator$Bitwise XOR Operator,The ^ operator performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation$where bits set in one operand but not both are set to 1.,Useful in algorithms that require toggling bits. For instance$a = 0b1010 and b = 0b1100$the result of a ^ b would be 0b0110. It's particularly handy in cryptography 
~ operator$Bitwise NOT Operator$Complement operator,The ~ operator inverts all the bits of its operand$performing a bitwise NOT operation.,This can be used to generate the bitwise complement of a number$which is crucial in binary arithmetic. For example$~0b0011 yields 0b1100 in a 4-bit system. In Python$it's calculated as -(x+1) due to Python's use of signed integer representations.
:= operator$Assignment Operator,Introduced in Python 3.8$the walrus operator allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression.,"This is particularly useful in loops and conditions to assign and check values in a single expression$reducing code duplication. Example: if (n := len(a)) > 10: print(f""List is too long with {n} elements"")."
True value$boolean true,True is a boolean value in Python that represents the truth.,"Boolean values$True and False$are often used in control flow and logical testing. Example: if True: print(""This always prints."")."
False value$boolean false,False is the boolean value that indicates falsehood.,"It is used in conditions and loops to control execution flow. Example: while False: print(""This will never print."")."
False keyword,Identical to the False value$used as a boolean literal in Python.,"In a condition such as if not False: print(""This prints because 'not False' is True."")."
await keyword,await is used to pause the execution of a coroutine until a promise is resolved or a task is completed.,Commonly used in asynchronous programming$allowing Python to handle other tasks while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete. Example: result = await fetch_data() pauses the coroutine$letting the event loop run other tasks until fetch_data() is done.
else keyword,The else keyword is used to execute a block of code when the condition in the if statement is False.,"It can also be used in loops (with for or while) to execute a block of code when the loop completes normally (no break). Example: for i in range(3): print(i) else: print(""Loop completed without break."")."
import keyword,import is used to bring modules into the namespace$allowing their functions and classes to be accessed.,Modules separate functionality and help in organizing code. Example: import math lets you use math.sqrt(4) to compute the square root.
pass keyword,pass is a null operation — when it's executed$nothing happens.,It is used as a placeholder for future code. When included in a code block$it allows the block to run without any operation. For example$defining a new class or function that you plan to implement later but want to leave empty for now:def function_that_does_nothing():@#    pass
None keyword,None is the Python null value type.,"It is often used to represent the absence of a value$as when default arguments are not passed to a function. For example$checking if a variable has been set to a meaningful value:result = None@#if result is None:@#    print(""No result yet."")"
break keyword,break terminates the nearest enclosing loop.,It immediately exits a loop$regardless of the loop's condition. Commonly used in loop control to exit when a condition is met$for instance:for number in range(100):@#    if number > 50:@#        break@#    print(number)
except keyword,except is used to catch exceptions in a try-except block.," It defines a block of code to be executed$if an error occurs in the try block. For example$catching a division by zero error:try:@#    result = 10 / 0@#except ZeroDivisionError:@#    print(""You cannot divide by zero."")"
in keyword,in checks if a value exists within an iterable.,"It is often used in loops or conditionals to check membership within lists$tuples$sets$or keys in dictionaries. For example:if 'apple' in ['banana'$'cherry'$'apple']:@#    print(""Apple is in the list."")"
raise keyword,raise is used to trigger an exception in Python.,"You can define what kind of error to raise$depending on the condition. It is useful for creating custom exceptions:if type(value) != int:@#    raise TypeError(""Only integers are allowed"")"
True keyword,True is a boolean type representing the truth.,"Used in logical operations$True evaluates to a boolean true. For instance:if True:@#    print(""This is always True."")"
class keyword,class is used to define a new user-defined object in Python.,"Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a class involves defining methods (functions) that operate on its data$and often initialization of objects via the __init__ method. For example:class Car:@#    def __init__(self$make$model):@#        self.make = make@#        self.model = model@#@#    def display_info(self):@#        print(f""Car make: {self.make}$Model: {self.model}"")@#my_car = Car(""Toyota""$""Corolla"")@#my_car.display_info()"
finally keyword,finally is part of try-except block$it defines a block of code that will be executed no matter if the try block raises an error or not.," Often used to release external resources$like closing files or connections$regardless of whether an exception was raised:try:@#    f = open(""file.txt"")@#    data = f.read()@#finally:@#    f.close()@#    print(""File is closed."")"
is keyword,is tests identity — it checks if two references point to the same object.,Unlike ==$which checks equality or value similarity$is checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. For example:a = [1$2$3]@#b = a@#print(b is a)  # This will print True
return keyword,return exits a function and optionally returns a value.,Used to send back the result of a function to its caller. For instance: def add(a$b):@#    return a + b
continue keyword,continue skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration.,It's used when certain conditions are met$and you want to skip the current iteration without breaking out of the loop entirely. For example$in a loop processing a list$continue can be used to skip processing an element if it doesn't meet certain criteria:for number in range(10):@#    if number % 2 == 0:@#        continue  # Skip even numbers@#    print(number)  # This line only executes for odd numbers
for keyword,The for keyword in Python is used to iterate over elements of a sequence (such as a list$tuple$dictionary$or string) or other iterable objects.,"Looping Through a Sequence: The for loop in Python allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for each item in an iterable. This makes it ideal for situations where you need to perform an action for each element in a sequence. This avoids the need for indexing and counters$making code cleaner and more readable.Example: fruits = [""apple""$""banana""$""cherry""]@#for fruit in fruits:@#    print(f""I like {fruit}"") In this example$the for loop iterates over the list fruits. Each iteration picks the next fruit in the list and executes the print statement with the current fruit name. This code prints: I like apple@#I like banana@#I like cherry Iterating Through a Dictionary: A for loop can also iterate through a dictionary$which allows you to access keys$values$or both using methods like .keys()$.values()$or .items().Example:person_info = {""name"": ""John""$""age"": 30$""city"": ""New York""}@#for key$value in person_info.items():@#    print(f""{key}: {value}"") This code iterates over each item in the person_info dictionary. The method .items() returns pairs of keys and values$which are unpacked into key and value. The output will be:name: John@#age: 30@#city: New York"
lambda keyword,lambda creates an anonymous function (a function without a name).,It's useful for small functions that are not complex enough to need a full function definition. Commonly used with functions like map()$filter()$and sorted(). For example$sorting a list of tuples by the second element can be done with a lambda:pairs = [(1$'one')$(2$'two')$(3$'three')$(4$'four')]@#pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])@#print(pairs)  # Outputs the list sorted by the second element of each tuple
try keyword,The try keyword is part of Python's error handling system. It begins a block of code that will be attempted$which might potentially lead to an error or exception.,"In Python$the try statement is used to catch and handle exceptions$which are errors detected during execution. The code inside a try block is executed first. If an error occurs$the rest of the try block is skipped$and code in the following except block is executed. If no error occurs$the except block is skipped. Here’s an example that demonstrates how the try keyword is used:try:@#    # Try to convert a string to an integer@#    user_input = '123'@#    result = int(user_input)@#    print(""Conversion successful:""$result)@#except ValueError:@#    # This block runs if there was a ValueError@#    print(""Failed to convert user input to an integer."")  The try block contains code that converts a string to an integer.@#If the string were something like 'abc' instead of '123'$converting it to an integer would fail and raise a ValueError.@#Since '123' is a valid integer$the conversion is successful$and the except block is not executed. The program prints ""Conversion successful: 123"".@#If user_input were 'abc'$it would print ""Failed to convert user input to an integer."" after catching the ValueError.@#The try-except structure is essential for building robust programs$especially when dealing with unpredictable data input$file operations$or network connections where errors are likely to occur."
as keyword,The as keyword in Python is primarily used in two contexts: for creating aliases when importing modules and for renaming exceptions in exception handling.,"Import Aliasing: The as keyword allows you to import a module under a different name to avoid conflicts with names in your current namespace or to shorten the name for convenience. This is particularly useful when you are importing modules that have long or inconvenient names.Example: import numpy as np@#array = np.array([1$2$3])@#print(array) In this example$numpy is imported as np$which makes it easier and quicker to reference. This is commonly seen in Python scripts that utilize libraries with complex or frequently used functions.@#Exception Handling: In exception handling$as is used to assign the exception to a variable$which can then be used to analyze or log the error further.Example: try:@#    # Trying to open a non-existent file@#    with open('file.txt'$'r') as file:@#        read_data = file.read()@#except FileNotFoundError as e:@#    print(f""The file was not found: {e}"") Here$if the file file.txt does not exist$the FileNotFoundError is caught and assigned to the variable e. The variable e then holds the exception object that includes details about the error$which we print out.@#These uses of the as keyword help streamline code and enhance error management in Python programs$making your code more robust and maintainable."
def keyword,def starts a function definition.,A function is a block of organized$reusable code used to perform a single action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. For example:def add(a$b):@#    return a + b@#result = add(5$3)@#print(result)  # Outputs 8
from keyword,The from keyword is used in import statements to import specific parts of a module, This keyword allows for importing specific attributes or functions from a module$rather than the entire module$which can help keep the namespace clean and improve script performance. For example:from math import sqrt@#print(sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
nonlocal keyword,The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variables inside nested functions.,"It allows you to assign values to a variable in an outer (but non-global) scope. This is useful when you want to modify a variable inside a nested function. For example:def outer():@#    x = ""local""@#    def inner():@#        nonlocal x@#        x = ""nonlocal""@#    inner()@#    return x@#print(outer())  # Output: nonlocal"
while keyword,The while keyword is used to perform a loop that continues as long as a condition is ,It's used for repeating a block of code an unknown number of times as long as the condition remains true. For example:x = 5@#while x > 0:@#    print(x)@#    x -= 1
assert keyword,assert is used for debugging purposes$to check for conditions that should always be true.," If the condition is false$it raises an AssertionError. This can be used to find bugs more quickly and with clearer intent. For example:assert 2 + 2 == 4$""The calculation should equal 4"""
del keyword,The del keyword is used to delete objects in Python., It can remove variables$items from lists$or keys from dictionaries. For example a = [1$2$3]@#del a[1]@#print(a)  # Output: [1$3]
global keyword,The global keyword allows you to modify a variable outside of the current scope.,It is used to declare that a variable inside a function is global$thus modifications to it will affect the variable's value outside the function. For example:x = 5@#def func():@#    global x@#    x = 10@#func()@#print(x)  # Output: 10
not keyword,not is a logical operator used to invert the truth value.,"It effectively negates whatever boolean value it precedes. If something is True$not makes it False$and vice versa. For example:x = True@#if not x:@#    print(""This will not print."")"
with keyword,The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by the context manager.,This is helpful for scenarios where setup and cleanup actions are needed. It makes the code cleaner and ensures that resources are handled correctly. For example$when working with files:with open('file.txt'$'r') as file:@#    data = file.read()
async keyword,async marks a function as an asynchronous coroutine.,Such functions are meant to be run in an event loop$which allows Python to perform other tasks while waiting for something to complete. For example:async def fetch_data():@#    data = await some_io_task()@#    return data
elif keyword,elif stands for else if$which checks another condition if the previous conditions were false.," It allows for multiple expressions to be evaluated in a straightforward manner$providing a clear path for branching logic. For example:x = 20@#if x < 10:@#    print(""Less than 10"")@#elif x < 20:@#    print(""Less than 20"")@#else:@#    print(""20 or more"")"
if keyword,if tests a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.,"It is the most common way to implement decision-making in Python. Code inside an if block will execute only when the condition evaluates to True. For example:if x > 0:@#    print(""Positive number"")"
or keyword,or checks if at least one of the conditions around it is True.,"It is useful when you want to execute a block of code when multiple conditions could lead to the same action. If any of the conditions are True$the or operation yields True. For example:if name == ""Alice"" or age < 12:@#    print(""Access granted"")"
yield keyword,yield is used in a function like return$except the function returns a generator.,When the function is called$the code in the function body executes until it hits a yield statement. Each time yield runs$it provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses its state. Example:def count_up_to(max):@#    count = 1@#    while count <= max:@#        yield count@#        count += 1@#@#counter = count_up_to(5)@#for num in counter:@#    print(num)
clear(),The clear() method removes all items from the dictionary$list$tuple$or set.,This method is straightforward and clears all the contents of the dictionary$tuple$list$or set$leaving it empty. Useful when you need to reset a dictionary without creating a new one. Example:person.clear()@#print(person) Outputs an empty dictionary:{}
update() dictionary$ update dictionary,The update() method updates the dictionary with elements from another dictionary or from an iterable of key-value pairs.,It allows you to combine dictionaries or add multiple key-value pairs simultaneously$modifying the original dictionary. For example:person.update({'gender': 'Female'$'age': 26})@#print(person) Results in the dictionary:{'name': 'Alice'$'age': 26$'gender': 'Female'}
pop() dictionary$ pop dictionary,The pop() method removes and returns an element from a dictionary given its key.,"t's a useful method for both retrieving the value and removing the key from the dictionary simultaneously. If the key does not exist$you can specify a default return value to avoid a KeyError. Example:age = person.pop('age'$None)@#print(f""The popped age is: {age}"")@#print(person) This would output:The popped age is: 26@#{'name': 'Alice'$'gender': 'Female'}"
values() dictionary$values dictionary,The values() method returns a view object containing the values of the dictionary.,This method is handy when you need to access or manipulate just the values from a dictionary. For example:for value in person.values():@#    print(value) Outputs:Alice@#25
keys() dictionary$keys dictionary,The keys() method returns a view object containing the keys of the dictionary.,Useful for looping directly over the keys of a dictionary or when you need to check if certain keys exist. Example:for key in person.keys():@#    print(key) This would print the keys of the person dictionary: name@#age
items() dictionary$items dictionary,The items() method returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.,"This method is particularly useful when you need to iterate over both keys and values in the dictionary$as it allows you to access each item as a tuple. For example:for key$value in person.items():@#    print(f""{key}: {value}"") This will output:name: Alice@#age: 25"
get() dictionary$get dictionary,The get() method returns the value for a specified key in the dictionary.,This method is safer than accessing values directly with square brackets because it allows you to specify a default value if the key is not found$thus preventing a KeyError. For example:person = {'name': 'Alice'$'age': 25}@#print(person.get('name'))  # Outputs: Alice@#print(person.get('gender'$'Not Specified'))  # Outputs: Not Specified
Insert Tuple$insert() tuple,Finds the first index of a specified value in the tuple. Raises a ValueError if the value is not found.,This method is used to find the position of a specific value that first appears in a tuple. Remember$since tuples are immutable$finding positions is one of the few things you can query. Example:my_tuple = (1$2$3$4)@#print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Outputs: 2  If the value isn’t present$it throws an error:print(my_tuple.index(5))  # Raises ValueError
Count Tuple$count() tuple,Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple,This method provides a simple way to check the frequency of an element in a tuple$which is an immutable sequence type. For example:my_tuple = (1$2$3$2$2$4)@#print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Outputs: 3
append(),Adds an item to the end of the list.,This method is used to add a single item to the existing list. It modifies the list in-place and does not return any value. For example:animals = ['cat'$'dog'$'bird']@#animals.append('fish')@#print(animals)  # Outputs: ['cat'$'dog'$'bird'$'fish']
extend(), Adds all elements of an iterable (like a list$tuple$string) to the end of the list.,Similar to .append()$but instead of adding a single item$.extend() can add multiple items from any iterable. For example:numbers = [1$2$3]@#numbers.extend([4$5])@#print(numbers)  # Outputs: [1$2$3$4$5]
add(),Adds an element to the set.,This method is used to add a single element to a set. Unlike lists$sets do not allow duplicate entries. If the element already exists in the set$the set doesn't change. For example:my_set = {1$2$3}@#my_set.add(4)@#print(my_set)  # Outputs: {1$2$3$4}@#my_set.add(2)@#print(my_set)  # Outputs: {1$2$3$4}$no duplicate added
copy(), Returns a copy of the set$list$dict$or tuple.,This method creates a shallow copy of the set$tuple$dict$or list$meaning it duplicates the set object without duplicating the objects it contains. Useful for working with a copy without affecting the original set. For example:my_set = {1$2$3}@#another_set = my_set.copy()@#another_set.add(4)@#print(my_set)  # Outputs: {1$2$3}@#print(another_set)  # Outputs: {1$2$3$4}
